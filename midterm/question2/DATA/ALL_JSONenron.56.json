This, he tells his fianc\u00e9e breathlessly, is what four years of college and three years of business school have been all about. On the morning of April 1, 2001, Brian (Christian Kane) puts on a suit, drives to the office beaming with enthusiasm and begins his glamorous new job. At Enron. At least two references to the April Fool's Day start date are made in ''The Crooked E: The Unshredded Truth About Enron,'' an oversimplified but not uninteresting film that has its premiere Sunday night on CBS. It's a little disappointing to check the 2001 calendar and see that April 1 was a Sunday.

They now have, and he should. Mr. White is a West Point graduate who served two tours of duty in Vietnam and eventually rose to be a brigadier general on Colin Powell's staff in the late 1980's. He then worked as an Enron executive for 11 years. Federal investigators are trying to determine whether he violated insider-trading laws when he unloaded $12.1 million worth of Enron stock last year, between June and October. This is only one of several inquiries Mr. White is likely to be facing in coming months. When he was tapped by the Bush administration for the Pentagon post, he was vice chairman of Enron's Energy Services unit. That operation has since been accused by former employees of having engaged in the types of improper accounting that led to the company's downfall, though Mr. White denies any wrongdoing.","abstract":"Editorial says Army Sec Thomas White promised to resign if questions stemming from his ties to Enron become too much of a distraction; says he faces several Enron-related inquiries in coming months, and time has come for him to acknowledge that he no longer has credibility to fulfill his mission at Pentagon; says he should keep his promise and resign","print_page":"26","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"The Army Secretary's Duty"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"WHITE, THOMAS E"},{"name":"organizations","value":"ENRON CORP"},{"name":"subject","value":"SUSPENSIONS, DISMISSALS AND RESIGNATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"ACCOUNTING AND ACCOUNTANTS"},{"name":"subject","value":"EDITORIALS"},{"name":"subject","value":"ETHICS"},{"name":"subject","value":"BANKRUPTCIES"},{"name":"subject","value":"UNITED STATES ARMAMENT AND DEFENSE"}],"pub_date":"2002-04-18T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Editorial Desk","section_name":"Opinion","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Editorial","_id":"4fd22f6d8eb7c8105d7bda6c","word_count":569,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2002\/04\/10\/business\/enron-s-many-strands-examiner-granted-in-enron-bankruptcy.html","snippet":"The judge overseeing the Enron bankruptcy proceedings ordered the appointment of an independent examiner yesterday as a first step toward determining potential liability in the case.
