Gift shops in many airports have stopped selling scissors, nail clippers, eyeglass-repair kits and anything else that might be converted into a weapon. On board, there are no more steak knives in first class. And perhaps that's just as well, since on many flights, there is no more steak.

What about Ogasawara-gunto in the Bonin Islands off Japan or the Bismarck Archipelago in the Southwest Pacific? If the answer is yes, perhaps a membership in the Travelers' Century Club is in the offing. The club regards itself as one of the world's most exclusive because eligibility is limited to individuals who have visited 100 or more countries or island groups. Membership now stands at something beyond 600, but affiliation of sorts is open to those who have yet to achieve the century mark, which is admittedly difficult. For example, someone who has been to the United States, Canada and Mexico, to all the countries in Europe and to every country in South America has a total of 55, and, tossing in Oriental countries and others bordering the Mediterranean, the club puts the total at 89, still 11 short of qualification.","abstract":null,"print_page":"3","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"TRAVEL ADVISORY: GLOBETROTTING, DANISH DELIGHTS"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"TRAVEL AND VACATIONS"}],"pub_date":"1983-07-10T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Travel Desk","section_name":null,"subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1},{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Visiting","rank":2,"lastname":"Countries"}],"original":"Qualify for Club, By Visiting 100 Countries"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd146238eb7c8105d620b8f","word_count":1474,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/abstract.html?res=9D05E0DE113BE13BBC4B53DFB066838A649EDE","snippet":"WASHINGTON, June 2--The United States prohibited until further notice today all travel to Czechoslovakia by citizens of this country....","lead_paragraph":"WASHINGTON, June 2--The United States prohibited until further notice today all travel to Czechoslovakia by citizens of this country.","abstract":"US bans travel by Amers except by special approval; those already in Czech excluded","print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"U.S. Bans Travel to Czechoslovakia, Calls Conditions There Hazardous; U.S. HALTS TRAVEL TO CZECHOSLOVAKIA"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"CZECHOSLOVAKIA"},{"name":"glocations","value":"EUROPE"},{"name":"glocations","value":"CZECH"},{"name":"organizations","value":"FOREIGN RELATIONS AND SERVICE"},{"name":"subject","value":"TRAVEL AND VACATIONS"}],"pub_date":"1951-06-03T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":null,"section_name":null,"subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1}],"original":"Special to THE NEW YORK TIMES"},"type_of_material":"Front Page","_id":"4fc3968245c1498b0d774d8e","word_count":449,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/abstract.html?res=9F0DE6D8103FE23BBC4F52DFB667838B649EDE","snippet":"WASHINGTON, Oct. 16--The State Department disclosed today that, for the time being at least, Spaniards, even though members of the Falange party, may obtain visas to come to the United States, as they did before the new Federal Security Law went i...","lead_paragraph":"WASHINGTON, Oct. 16--The State Department disclosed today that, for the time being at least, Spaniards, even though members of the Falange party, may obtain visas to come to the United States, as they did before the new Federal Security Law went into effect.","abstract":"US State Dept aide repts Argentines are not excluded from US under US law barring totalitarians","print_page":"19","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"U.S. DOES NOT BAR FALANGE MEMBERS; Argentines, Like Spaniards, May Obtain Visas Under New Security Law Versions Do Not Jibe"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"UNITED STATES"},{"name":"glocations","value":"UNITED STATES"},{"name":"glocations","value":"UNITED STATES"},{"name":"glocations","value":"UNITED STATES"},{"name":"glocations","value":"ARGENTINA"},{"name":"subject","value":"TRAVEL AND VACATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"TRAVEL AND VACATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"TRAVEL AND VACATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"TRAVEL AND VACATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT"}],"pub_date":"1950-10-17T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":null,"section_name":null,"subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"Jay","middlename":"Walz","lastname":"Special","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By JAY WALZ Special to THE NEW YORK TIMES"},"type_of_material":"Article","_id":"4fc317b945c1498b0d743272","word_count":497,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1994\/06\/05\/travel\/l-family-cruising-258130.html","snippet":"To the Editor: Did Betsy Wade and I really go on the same American Family Cruise trip, and the same week, no less?

The cruise itself had many problems; children of all ages ran everywhere unsupervised. The table next to ours had only children under about the age of 12 who were so loud that we could often not hear ourselves speak. The roller-skating meant passengers walked about at their peril.
