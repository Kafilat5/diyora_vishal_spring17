The Atrium has experienced some shakeout during its first three years, however. According to Donald Trump, who owns the space in partnership with the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States, about ''15 to 20 percent'' of the 40 stores in the complex have closed or left since 1983.

In retrospect, looking around their elegant but startling living room, they admit they hadn't really known exactly what the result would be. Mr. Minars took his clients at their word, and rather than shopping in showrooms for predictable pieces, he decided to buy art furniture. The resulting apartment summarizes one of the latest and strongest trends in New York design, 1986: the chairs, tables, desks, cabinets and lights are all designed by artists as one-of-a-kind, signed pieces, with strident colors, odd shapes and angular profiles. Despite their individuality, they add up to a coherent look and a strong statement.","abstract":null,"print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"APARTMENT OF THE MOMENT: THE LATEST IN TRENDS"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"MINARS, ALLEN"},{"name":"glocations","value":"NEW YORK CITY"},{"name":"glocations","value":"TRUMP TOWER"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERIOR DECORATION"},{"name":"subject","value":"APARTMENT HOUSES"}],"pub_date":"1986-01-02T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Home Desk","section_name":"Home and Garden; Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Joseph","rank":1,"lastname":"GIOVANNINI"}],"original":"By JOSEPH GIOVANNINI"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd149948eb7c8105d6266cd","word_count":1164,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2009\/08\/16\/style\/tmagazine\/16timeless.html","snippet":"I got this because I wanted to add some razzle and dazzle to my glamorous evening gowns \u2014 something new and sexy.
