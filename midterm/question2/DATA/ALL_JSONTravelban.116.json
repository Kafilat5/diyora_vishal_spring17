On Dec. 5, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who has reigned since 1950, will reach his 60th birthday. Events will be nationwide, beginning Oct. 16 with a royal barge procession on Bangkok's Chao Phraya River. These magnificent slender boats, built to transport royalty in a country of rivers and canals, are now seldom seen outside their storage wharf. But they have been refurbished for this event. The Tourism Authority of Thailand plans to erect viewing stands at four points along the Chao Phraya, and will sell seats at about $11.50, on a first-come, first-served basis. Booking requests can be directed to its Marketing Development Division, Ractchadamnoen Nok Avenue, Bangkok 10100. On Dec. 3, there will be a Trooping of the Color, and on Dec. 5, the King's birthday and a national holiday, ceremonies and celebrations are planned for temples in Bangkok and beyond. From Dec. 4 to 6, three royal barges will be on view at Rajaworadit Pier.","abstract":null,"print_page":"14","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"SEEING MORE THAN BANGKOK: A BRIEF GUIDE"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"THAILAND"},{"name":"subject","value":"TRAVEL AND VACATIONS"}],"pub_date":"1986-12-21T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Travel Desk","section_name":"Travel","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Barbara","rank":1,"lastname":"CROSSETTE"}],"original":"By BARBARA CROSSETTE"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd165c78eb7c8105d652caf","word_count":1871,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1982\/04\/25\/travel\/the-trouble-with-italy.html","snippet":"DONALD E.

WESTLAKE is a novelist who lives in New York. His latest book, ''Kahawa,'' has just been published by Viking. By DONALD E.WESTLAKE Ihave just returned from my third visit to Italy, and I must sit down a moment. Italy is the warehouse of western man's history, the immediate source of our art, our law, our religion and our plumbing. The first time you travel there a great exhilaration builds, as you come to realize what a true Wonderland it is, in every possible way. Here are history and religion emblemized, simplified, dramatized, laid out before you like all the materials of a correspondence course arriving on the same day. The arts of painting and sculpture and architecture have never seemed so various and rich and self-assured. The landscape, green and yellow and warm blue, with cold blue mountaintops, is itself a panoramic painting into which, as in a children's story, you can drive in your little rented Fiat Panda. The food is not the tomato-soaked ''Italian'' of America but bounteous and varied and wonderful, as though you were a guest in the largest, most successful, best-run farmhouse on earth. You spend your days, your weeks, and you go home delighted, swearing to return.","abstract":null,"print_page":"45","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"THE TROUBLE WITH ITALY"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"ITALY"},{"name":"subject","value":"TRAVEL AND VACATIONS"}],"pub_date":"1982-04-25T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Travel Desk","section_name":"Travel","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd122768eb7c8105d5e50ea","word_count":2235,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/abstract.html?res=9402E2DD143BE43BBC4850DFB2668389669EDE","snippet":"RICHMOND, England -- If you want London, stay in Russell Square.
