Now, it looks as if the only innovations the company will be remembered for are the many labyrinthine schemes it used to mislead investors about its financial position. It is not yet clear how early and often Enron substituted fantasy for reality in its reports to shareholders. But knowing the extent of the dishonesty is central to answering the question many people asked as they watched Enron implode. How could a company as big, profitable and powerful as Enron slide into oblivion so quickly?","abstract":"Enron's recent financial statements employed fuzzy math to show continuing strong growth in revenues and earnings, but analysis of figures would have revealed indications of big problems before bottom fell out in fall of 2001; understanding that Enron's profits were not nearly what company said they were helps to explain its quick demise, but it is in no way clear why company was so starved for cash that it had to borrow almost $6 billion in six weeks after its third-quarter earnings bombshell and leading up to bankruptcy filing; Robert F McCullough, authority on electric utility industry, highlights some of discrepancies in financial statements; photo; graph (L)","print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"How 287 Turned Into 7: Lessons in Fuzzy Math"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"MCCULLOUGH, ROBERT F"},{"name":"organizations","value":"ENRON CORP"},{"name":"subject","value":"ACCOUNTING AND ACCOUNTANTS"},{"name":"subject","value":"FINANCES"}],"pub_date":"2002-01-20T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Money and Business\/Financial Desk","section_name":"Business","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Gretchen","rank":1,"lastname":"MORGENSON"}],"original":"By GRETCHEN MORGENSON"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd2335f8eb7c8105d7c3f9d","word_count":1932,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2002\/01\/17\/business\/enron-s-collapse-vulnerable-growing-number-potential-targets-for-lawsuits.html","snippet":"With each new report of possible misdeeds by professionals who worked for or with the Enron Corporation, the list of deep-pocketed potential targets of civil and criminal lawsuits resulting from the company's spectacular collapse grows longer.

The failure of the politically powerful energy trading company is the biggest corporate bankruptcy in the nation's history. Given the company's close ties to the Bush administration, and its generous campaign contributions to members of Congress, only an exacting and unflinching set of investigations can assure the country that Enron executives are not receiving special treatment from the government. So far, the White House is taking the right steps. We trust its determination will not flag in the months ahead, even if embarrassing questions come up about Enron's ties to the administration. The Justice Department decision to create a special task force to determine whether to bring criminal charges against Enron or its officers appears to be a recognition of both the complexity and the importance of this case. Such task forces, based in Washington but involving prosecutors around the country, are usually reserved for potential crimes of national import, and this is certainly that. Thousands of unsuspecting Enron employees lost much of their retirement savings while company officials enriched themselves by dumping their stock before the plight of the company became known.","abstract":"Editorial calls for exacting and unflinching set of investigations into demise of Enron Corp to assure country that Enron executives are not receiving special treatment from government; says White House is taking right steps so far, and hopes its determination will not flag in months ahead, even if embarrassing questions come up about Enron's ties to administration","print_page":"20","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"The Enron Investigations"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"BUSH, GEORGE W"},{"name":"organizations","value":"ENRON CORP"},{"name":"subject","value":"EDITORIALS"},{"name":"subject","value":"ETHICS"},{"name":"subject","value":"BANKRUPTCIES"}],"pub_date":"2002-01-11T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Editorial Desk","section_name":"Opinion","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Editorial","_id":"4fd21b2b8eb7c8105d79a13c","word_count":651,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2001\/12\/23\/business\/chills-in-the-balance-sheet-shadows.html","snippet":"PAY no attention to those liabilities behind the curtain.
