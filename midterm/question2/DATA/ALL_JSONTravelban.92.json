We wanted to go to Vientiane in Laos to get the feel of the city, to see what French colonial buildings remain and to see the genocide museum and the killing fields. What we hoped for was to find out if the old French influence was still visible, if the French language was still spoken by some people, how Laotian people view their past as a French colony and how they view Americans since the end of the Vietnam War. This picture of a young Buddhist novice was taken on the bamboo bridge, which has to be rebuilt annually after it is swept away by rising waters on the Nam Khan River. The bridge links the city of Luang Prabang to picturesque villages like Ban Phong Pheng, on the other side of the river. It was taken around 4 p.m., when the Buddhist novices come back home from their studies.

Close to 5.2 million acres have been consumed, and with dry conditions expected to last in many places for several more weeks, perhaps until the first snows of late autumn, anyone traveling near wilderness areas should check fire conditions and travel or camping restrictions. The best way to do so is to visit www.nifc .gov, the Web site for the National Interagency Fire Center, headquartered in Boise, Idaho. It has frequently updated reports on fires, fire-danger advisories, travel and road conditions and maps, as well as links to the seven agencies represented by the center and to Web sites for individual national parks and forests, and some state areas as well.
