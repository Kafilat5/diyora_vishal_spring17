Since Memorial Day, thousands of wildfires have burned about a half million acres of mostly forest land and threatened some communities. But even with intermittent road closures and evacuations of residents, and cancellation of Fourth of July events in some areas, it's been business as usual at most attractions, parks and beaches, state tourism officials said -- even under a blanket of smoke. Everglades National Park in southern Florida, Miami-Dade County beaches and Walt Disney World in Orlando reported no commercial impact from the blazes as of early July, even when some had operated under hazy skies from distant fires.","abstract":"Article on impact on Florida's tourist industry of thousands of wildfires that have burned since Memorial Day; most hotels and attractions report no drop in attendance or cancellations; worst disruptions are in northeast region (M)","print_page":"3","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Florida Tourism Goes On Despite Blanket of Smoke","kicker":"TRAVEL ADVISORY: CORRESPONDENT'S REPORT"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"FLORIDA"},{"name":"subject","value":"FIRES AND FIREMEN"},{"name":"subject","value":"FOREST AND BRUSH FIRES"},{"name":"subject","value":"TRAVEL AND VACATIONS"}],"pub_date":"1998-07-19T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Travel Desk","section_name":null,"subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Mireya","rank":1,"lastname":"NAVARRO"}],"original":"By MIREYA NAVARRO"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd2190d8eb7c8105d796a1d","word_count":710,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/abstract.html?res=9501E4D91339E43BBC4E52DFB2668388679EDE","snippet":"WASHINGTON, April 15 Americans traveling overseas will still be able to send home small gifts duty-free....","lead_paragraph":"WASHINGTON, April 15 Americans traveling overseas will still be able to send home small gifts duty-free.","abstract":"Customa Bur postpones ban on free entry of $1-10 gifts; says abuses have lessened","print_page":"7","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Customs Bureau Postpones Ban On Free Entry of $1-to-$10 Gifts; More Inspections Planned Orders Solicited"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"UNITED STATES"},{"name":"subject","value":"TRAVEL AND VACATIONS"}],"pub_date":"1963-04-16T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":null,"section_name":null,"subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"Eileen","middlename":"Shanahan","lastname":"Special","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By EILEEN SHANAHAN Special to The New York Times"},"type_of_material":"Article","_id":"4fc410ec45c1498b0d8e93ca","word_count":481,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1995\/10\/01\/travel\/travel-advisory-correspondent-s-report-bombings-bring-paris-unaccustomed.html","snippet":"IT is probably fair to say that if Paris were not normally such a safe city a recent spate of terrorist bombs would not have been so disturbing.

The bill also prevents the president or his successors from changing the prohibitions without the approval of Congress. But for all the Congressional huffing and puffing over passage of the bill, tour operators say things are not likely to change much, if at all. Naturalized American citizens born in Cuba will still be allowed to travel there, as apparently will Americans who go as part of humanitarian, educational or athletic groups. Just about the only people likely to be affected by the legislation are Americans not born in Cuba who want to travel there on their own rather than in groups. And Americans who might otherwise have gone to Cuba illegally may decide not to, rather than test the United States government's resolve to enforce the newly codified law.","abstract":"Article on
