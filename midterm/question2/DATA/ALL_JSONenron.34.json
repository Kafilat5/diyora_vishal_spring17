Enron, which is selling its assets to repay creditors, estimates that employees will ultimately receive about $16.8 million in bonuses. The company, which is based in Houston, will cease to exist once the asset sales are finished. Judge Arthur Gonzalez of United States Bankruptcy Court in New York authorized the payments after the company said it needed to give employees an incentive to stay with Enron until the liquidation was complete. Enron estimates proceeds from the remaining asset sales will total $1.1 billion, which would mean employees would receive $16.8 million, Brian Rosen, Enron's lead bankruptcy lawyer, said. Judge Gonzalez authorized bonuses of as much as $45 million if the proceeds reach $3 billion or more.","abstract":"Enron Corp wins approval to pay as much as $45 million in bonuses to employees who are responsible for winding down company's operations; Enron estimates that employees will ultimately receive about $16.8 million in bonuses; company will cease to exist once asset sales are finished (S)l","print_page":"3","blog":[],"source":"Bloomberg News","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"BONUS PLAN FOR ENRON EMPLOYEES IS APPROVED","kicker":"COMPANY NEWS"},"keywords":[{"name":"organizations","value":"ENRON CORP"},{"name":"subject","value":"FRAUDS AND SWINDLING"},{"name":"subject","value":"LABOR"},{"name":"subject","value":"MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES"},{"name":"subject","value":"SHUTDOWNS (INSTITUTIONAL)"},{"name":"subject","value":"SUITS AND LITIGATION"},{"name":"subject","value":"ETHICS"},{"name":"subject","value":"BONUSES"},{"name":"subject","value":"DECISIONS AND VERDICTS"},{"name":"subject","value":"BANKRUPTCIES"}],"pub_date":"2005-01-21T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Business\/Financial Desk","section_name":"Business","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd25a748eb7c8105d8074bd","word_count":150,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2004\/04\/08\/business\/lea-fastow-withdraws-plea-in-tax-case.html","snippet":"Lea Fastow, the wife of Enron's former chief financial officer, withdrew her guilty plea on criminal tax charges yesterday after a federal judge announced that he would not abide by the terms of her agreement with the government.
