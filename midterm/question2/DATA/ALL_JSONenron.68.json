Regardless of whether any laws were broken in the spectacular collapse of one of the nation's largest companies, citizens of all political pipings have voiced disgust at accounts of top Enron executives selling off their stock in time to enrich themselves handsomely, while ordinary Enron employees were later forced to sit by in impotent desperation as their retirement savings evaporated.","abstract":"Scientists see public anger at Enron Corp officials who enriched selves as example of humanity's evolved and deep-seated hatred of the Cheat; say readiness to work for common good could not have evolved without corresponding eagerness to punish transgressors of social compact (M)","print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"The Urge to Punish Cheats: It Isn't Merely Vengeance"},"keywords":[{"name":"organizations","value":"ENRON CORP"},{"name":"subject","value":"ARCHAEOLOGY AND ANTHROPOLOGY"},{"name":"subject","value":"CHEATING"},{"name":"subject","value":"ETHICS"},{"name":"subject","value":"BANKRUPTCIES"}],"pub_date":"2002-01-22T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Science Desk","section_name":"Science; Health","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Natalie","rank":1,"lastname":"ANGIER"}],"original":"By NATALIE ANGIER"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd25bb78eb7c8105d809079","word_count":1413,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2002\/01\/13\/opinion\/l-the-fall-of-enron-messy-politics-115614.html","snippet":"To the Editor:    Re ''Enron Contacted 2 Cabinet Officers Before Collapsing'' (front page, Jan. 11):...","lead_paragraph":"To the Editor: Re ''Enron Contacted 2 Cabinet Officers Before Collapsing'' (front page, Jan. 11):","abstract":"Sam Schaefler letter says it would nice if political contributions made by Enron and its management were returned to Enron employees who have lost life savings in sordid collapse (S)","print_page":"16","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"The Fall of Enron: Messy Politics"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"SCHAEFLER, SAM"},{"name":"glocations","value":"UNITED STATES"},{"name":"organizations","value":"ENRON CORP"},{"name":"subject","value":"FINANCES"},{"name":"subject","value":"ETHICS"},{"name":"subject","value":"PENSIONS AND RETIREMENT PLANS"},{"name":"subject","value":"LOBBYING AND LOBBYISTS"},{"name":"subject","value":"ELECTIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"BANKRUPTCIES"}],"pub_date":"2002-01-13T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Editorial Desk","section_name":"Opinion","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Letter","_id":"4fd22ab28eb7c8105d7b5c25","word_count":50,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2001\/12\/14\/nyregion\/c-corrections-669857.html","snippet":"A picture caption in Business Day on Wednesday about the sentiment of former employees toward the Enron Corporation misidentified the woman shown.

Bush interrupted his inveighing against evildoers to crack a joke. Mr. Bush had repeatedly promised to run an overall budget surplus at least as large as the Social Security surplus, except in the event of recession, war or national emergency. ''Lucky me,'' he remarked to Mitch Daniels, his budget director. ''I hit the trifecta.'' Lucky him, indeed. The Enron analogy will soon become a tired clich\u00e9, but in this case the parallel is irresistible. Enron management and the administration Enron did so much to put in power applied the same strategy: First, use cooked numbers to justify big giveaways at the top. Then, if things don't work out, let ordinary workers who trusted you pay the price. But Enron executives got caught; Mr. Bush believes that the events of Sept. 11 will let him off the hook.","abstract":"Paul Krugman Op-Ed column likens Pres Bush's tax and budget plans to Enron, company that used cooked numbers to justify big giveaways at top and then let ordinary workers pay the price; recalls how Bush used projections of vast budget surpluses to push through huge tax cut earlier in year, and now tells us, through budget director Mitch Daniels, that entire budget, not just portion outside Social Security, will be in deficit through 2004 (M)","print_page":"31","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Hitting The Trifecta"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"BUSH, GEORGE W"},{"name":"persons","value":"DANIELS, MITCHELL E JR"},{"name":"glocations","value":"UNITED STATES"},{"name":"organizations","value":"ENRON CORP"},{"name":"subject","value":"FRAUDS AND SWINDLING"},{"name":"subject","value":"TAXATION"},{"name":"subject","value":"FINANCES"},{"name":"subject","value":"BUDGETS AND BUDGETING"}],"pub_date":"2001-12-07T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Editorial Desk","section_name":"Opinion","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Paul","lastname":"KRUGMAN"}],"original":"By PAUL KRUGMAN"},"type_of_material":"Op-Ed","_id":"4fd229978eb7c8105d7b3da3","word_count":735,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2001\/12\/03\/us\/enron-s-collapse-process-path-settling-claims-will-be-long-one-experts-say.html","snippet":"Yesterday's bankruptcy filing by the Enron Corporation and 13 of its affiliates would rank as the largest in history, according to analysts who follow bankruptcy filings.

The sheer size of the company, along with the complexity of its problems, could mean that it will take years before claims against the company are settled and creditors receive anything, these experts said. Enron and its affiliates had $50 billion in assets, according to yesterday's filings. That ranks the Enron bankruptcy ahead of the previous record holder: Texaco, which filed for bankruptcy in April 1987, with $35.9 billion in assets, according to BankruptcyData.com, a Web site that tracks such filings.","abstract":"Bankruptcy experts say it could take years before claims against Enron are settled and creditors get anything because of Enron's size and complexity of its problems; creditors, including some of nation's largest banks and energy companies, likely face hundreds of millions in losses; table of assets and debts (M)","print_page":"16","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Path to Settling the Claims Will Be a Long One, Experts Say","kicker":"ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE PROCESS"},"keywords":[{"name":"organizations","value":"ENRON CORP"},{"name":"subject","value":"BANKRUPTCIES"}],"pub_date":"2001-12-03T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"National Desk","section_name":"U.S.","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1}],"original":"By RIVA D.

Even after its broadband business reported large losses earlier this year, Enron boasted of its role as the world's largest bandwidth trader. It turns out, however, that the struggling market for trading bandwidth, the transmission capacity used to carry voice and data on communications networks, may transform itself and benefit from Enron's decline. After all, the dot-com implosion and a 90-percent-plus plunge in bandwidth prices in the last year and a half had already weakened the market. If there is any place for bandwidth trading to go now, analysts and traders say, it is up.","abstract":"Trading of telecommunications bandwidth as commodity will change markedly as result of Enron Corp's failure; market is glutted, with less than 10 percent of fiber optic cable buried under land and sea in use; other traders will fill vacuum left by Enron's absence (M)","print_page":"11","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Telecommunications; Bandwidth Traders' Uncertain Future"},"keywords":[{"name":"organizations","value":"ENRON CORP"},{"name":"subject","value":"DERIVATIVES (FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS)"},{"name":"subject","value":"FUTURES AND OPTIONS TRADING"},{"name":"subject","value":"FIBER OPTICS"},{"name":"subject","value":"TELEPHONES AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"COMPUTERS AND THE INTERNET"}],"pub_date":"2001-12-02T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Money and Business\/Financial Desk","section_name":"Technology; Business","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Simon","rank":1,"lastname":"ROMERO"}],"original":"By SIMON ROMERO"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd22ab38eb7c8105d7b5d34","word_count":308,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2001\/11\/27\/opinion\/l-stimulus-for-enron-378089.html","snippet":"To the Editor:    Re ''In New Filing, Enron Reports Debt Squeeze'' (Business Day, Nov. 20):     As Congress and federal investigators begin looking into a host of questions about management's role in the company's collapse, I note that the Bush-G....","lead_paragraph":"To the Editor: Re ''In New Filing, Enron Reports Debt Squeeze'' (Business Day, Nov. 20): As Congress and federal investigators begin looking into a host of questions about management's role in the company's collapse, I note that the Bush-G.O.P.
