Blakey, the administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration. Over a longer term, more runways and other facilities are needed, the United States Department of Transportation reported last week. The agency said the report is the first to evaluate in detail air travel patterns and economic and population projections against current service and capacity at domestic airports. According to the study, 15 airports will need to add capacity to accommodate growth over the next decade. The list includes Metropolitan Oakland International; Bob Hope in Burbank, Calif.; Long Beach; John Wayne-Orange County; Tucson International; Albuquerque International; San Antonio International; Houston Hobby; O'Hare International; LaGuardia; Kennedy International; Newark Liberty International; Philadelphia International; Palm Beach International and Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International. PRIVATE SCREENERS REDUX -- An 18-month test program at five airports to evaluate the benefits of allowing domestic airports to again use private companies, rather than federal employees, for passenger and baggage screening has been declared a success by the Department of Homeland Security. The agency issued guidelines last week for any airport interested in replacing federal screeners with private ones. The agency said that the test program had shown that security and customer service at the five participating airports was ''comparable to airports staffed with federal screeners.'' Airports wanting to replace federal employees with private ones for security screening can submit applications starting Nov. 19.","abstract":"Federal Aviation Administration administrator Marion C Blakey says 9 of 35 top airports in US are operating above their passenger levels before Sept 11, 2001, and 6 more will exceed pre-9\/11 passenger levels by end of year; US Transportation Department says more runways and other facilities are needed over longer term; 18-month test program at five airports to evaluate benefits of allowing domestic airports to again use private companies, rather then federal employees, for passenger and baggage screening is declared success by Homeland Security Department; corporate travel managers are increasingly uneasy about way federal government is putting in place plans with airlines for passenger screening system that will register and classify travelers based on perceived risk; corporate travel managers trade association is working with International Association of Privacy Professionals to define and evaluate overlap of corporate travel policies and data-privacy issues; Singapore government says it is allowing sale of 19 brands of chewing gum sold for 'medicinal' and 'dental' uses, but only in pharmacies; chewing gum was outlawed in 1992 because it fouled sidewalks and other public places (Memo Pad column) (M)","print_page":"6","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"MEMO PAD","kicker":"BUSINESS TRAVEL"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"BLAKEY, MARION C"},{"name":"glocations","value":"SINGAPORE"},{"name":"organizations","value":"INTERNATIONAL ASSN OF PRIVACY PROFESSIONALS"},{"name":"organizations","value":"TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT"},{"name":"organizations","value":"FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION"},{"name":"organizations","value":"HOMELAND SECURITY DEPARTMENT"},{"name":"subject","value":"AIRLINES AND AIRPLANES"},{"name":"subject","value":"SIDEWALKS"},{"name":"subject","value":"LUGGAGE"},{"name":"subject","value":"SECURITY AND WARNING SYSTEMS"},{"name":"subject","value":"TESTS AND TESTING"},{"name":"subject","value":"PRIVACY"},{"name":"subject","value":"DENTISTS"},{"name":"subject","value":"AIRPORTS"},{"name":"subject","value":"DRUGSTORES"},{"name":"subject","value":"CHEWING GUM"},{"name":"subject","value":"MEDICINE AND HEALTH"},{"name":"subject","value":"WASTE MATERIALS AND DISPOSAL"},{"name":"subject","value":"GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES"}],"pub_date":"2004-06-29T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Business\/Financial Desk","section_name":"Health; Business","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Joe","rank":1,"lastname":"SHARKEY"}],"original":"By JOE SHARKEY"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd256ad8eb7c8105d80073f","word_count":503,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2003\/12\/30\/business\/business-travel-memo-pad.html","snippet":"Scheduled Flights Increased 3% in 2003      The number of scheduled flights increased 3 percent worldwide in 2003 over 2002, according to year-end data from OAG, the publisher of airline schedules.
