Despite everything else that had happened, Enron said, its previous deals were still highly valuable. But every time Enron looks inside the trading book that holds its most important secrets, it sees deals that are worth less and less. At the time of the bankruptcy filing, Enron said the book's value had fallen from $12 billion to roughly $7 billion after merger discussions with Dynegy broke down. That was plenty to get a $1.5 billion loan from J. P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup to help the company sustain itself for a while.","abstract":"Book value of Enron Corp's trading desk, source of nearly all of its profits, has plunged, in part because of changes in market during fall and winter and in part because desk reportedly sometimes exaggerated worth of deals to inflate profits; company's bankruptcy reorganization plan revolves almost entirely around generating cash by liquidating unit that houses trading desk and still owns book; Enron has sold trading desk to UBS for percentage of profits it generates; some creditors hope Enron is merely trying to lower expectations with its low estimates of book's current value; photo (M)","print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"What Was the Heart of Enron Keeps Shrinking"},"keywords":[{"name":"organizations","value":"ENRON CORP"},{"name":"organizations","value":"UBS AG"},{"name":"subject","value":"MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES"},{"name":"subject","value":"ETHICS"},{"name":"subject","value":"BANKRUPTCIES"}],"pub_date":"2002-04-06T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Business\/Financial Desk","section_name":"Business","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Michael","rank":1,"lastname":"BRICK"}],"original":"By MICHAEL BRICK"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd268c18eb7c8105d81f39c","word_count":1470,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2002\/02\/16\/business\/elephant-s-e-irks-gop.html","snippet":"It comes as no surprise that the Republican Party of Texas does not find the World Wide Web site www.EnronOwnsTheGOP.com as amusing as the Texas Democrats who run it.
