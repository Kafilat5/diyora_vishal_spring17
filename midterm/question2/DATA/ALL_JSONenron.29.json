Skilling, an executive who came to the company only six years ago and built up a huge business trading natural gas and electricity. The fact that Mr. Skilling, 43, was appointed to the No. 2 job at Enron, under Kenneth L. Lay, the chairman and chief executive, shows how quickly the trading and marketing of natural gas and electricity are growing in importance as a result of utility deregulation and how hard companies are scrambling to keep up.","abstract":"Enron Corp names Jeffrey K Skilling president and chief operating officer; he succeeds Richard D Kinder and will remain Enron Capital & Trade Resources unit chairman (M)","print_page":"6","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Enron Names Trading Chief As President of Company"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"SKILLING, JEFFREY K"},{"name":"persons","value":"KINDER, RICHARD D"},{"name":"organizations","value":"ENRON CORP"},{"name":"subject","value":"SUSPENSIONS, DISMISSALS AND RESIGNATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"APPOINTMENTS AND EXECUTIVE CHANGES"}],"pub_date":"1996-12-11T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Business\/Financial Desk","section_name":"Business","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Agis","rank":1,"lastname":"SALPUKAS"}],"original":"By AGIS SALPUKAS"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd1cd328eb7c8105d703fd4","word_count":514,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1995\/12\/27\/business\/international-business-enron-goes-to-africa-seeking-gas-and-customers.html","snippet":"Beneath the rolling grasslands of southern Mozambique lies a huge reserve of  natural gas, which if piped to neighboring South Africa, could bring $100 million a year in hard currency to Mozambique, the poorest country in the world.

The war in the Persian Gulf exposed anew America's vulnerability to imported oil. Five years after Chernobyl, nuclear power is still shunned. And global warming has further darkened the cloud over coal. Cleaner and cheaper than oil, natural gas has become the favored fuel among manufacturers and power generators -- but only ideologically. Despite reserves in the United States and Canada that could last 50 years or more, gas has taken a back seat to oil, supplying only 23 percent of its fuel needs in 1989. A tangle of regulations has choked demand, produced shortages and kept prices low and most gas producers too small to vie for lucrative long-term industrial contracts. And unless it can overcome its reputation as an unreliable long-term fuel source, the gas industry will blow the nation's best chance for clearer skies, lower fuel bills and fewer geopolitical scares in the future.","abstract":null,"print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Bottom-Fishing in the Gas Patch"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"LAY, KENNETH L"},{"name":"organizations","value":"ENRON CORP"},{"name":"subject","value":"GAS (FUEL)"},{"name":"subject","value":"COMPANY AND ORGANIZATION PROFILES"},{"name":"subject","value":"CONTRACTS"}],"pub_date":"1991-05-19T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Financial Desk","section_name":"Business","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"Thomas","middlename":"C.","lastname":"HAYES","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By THOMAS C.
