The Shamrock Hotel, where the oil wildcatter Glenn McCarthy built the world's largest swimming pool in the '40s? Demolished in 1987, replaced by a park with some unfortunate phallic fountains.

The company's twin towers were long ago leased to more modest businesses; Enron Field became Minute Maid Park; and unless you lost a fortune, got sued or indicted or served time -- or were related to someone who was or did -- the shame of Enron's collapse is long gone.
