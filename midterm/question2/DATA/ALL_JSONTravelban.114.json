Many a visitor who arrives expecting to find an old, exotic Asian city is soon disappointed by a nondescript town where the traffic seems long ago to have gone out of control. Perspiring under the tropical sun or choking on fumes, the visitor flees indoors, which is not such a bad idea. Bangkok is a city of interiors. No trees? Not necessarily. They are hiding, with the flowers and the birds, behind high garden walls and gates. Bangkok viewed from the top of a tall hotel instead of from a crumbling curb is suddenly a different place. The city is not very historic, either; most East Coast American cities are older. So the history, and much of the culture of Thailand, a country with both Buddhist monks and Hindu gods, is stored in temples and museums and even hotel lobbies.","abstract":null,"print_page":"10","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"BANGKOK","kicker":"WAHT'S DOING IN"},"keywords":[{"name":"creative_works","value":"WHAT'S DOING IN...(TIMES COLUMN)"},{"name":"glocations","value":"THAILAND"},{"name":"glocations","value":"BANGKOK (THAILAND)"},{"name":"subject","value":"TRAVEL AND VACATIONS"}],"pub_date":"1986-02-16T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Travel Desk","section_name":"Travel","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Barbara","rank":1,"lastname":"Crossette"}],"original":"By Barbara Crossette; BARBARA CROSSETTE is chief of the Bangkok bureau of The Times"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd160d58eb7c8105d64ac8a","word_count":1820,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/abstract.html?res=9A03E0D7153CE53ABC4E52DFB266838E649EDE","snippet":"Governor Harriman yesterday signed new laws extending state anti-discrimination regulations in Federally aided housing....","lead_paragraph":"Governor Harriman yesterday signed new laws extending state anti-discrimination regulations in Federally aided housing.","abstract":"bills barring bias in pub aided and Fed-insured housing signed","print_page":"21","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"HARRIMAN WIDENS HOUSING BIAS BAN; Signs New Laws Extending It to the Federally Aided Projects--First in Nation"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"HARRIMAN, AVERELL"},{"name":"glocations","value":"NEW YORK STATE"},{"name":"glocations","value":"NYC"},{"name":"glocations","value":"NEW YORK STATE"},{"name":"subject","value":"MORTGAGES"},{"name":"subject","value":"CEMETERIES"},{"name":"subject","value":"TRAVEL AND VACATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"HOUSING"},{"name":"subject","value":"GENERAL"},{"name":"subject","value":"DISCRIMINATION"}],"pub_date":"1955-04-16T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":null,"section_name":null,"subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Article","_id":"4fc3af3345c1498b0d7e7467","word_count":293,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1990\/12\/23\/travel\/what-s-doing-in-bangkok.html","snippet":"About five million tourists come to Thailand every year, and nearly all of them stop in Bangkok, particularly at this time of the year, which is less humid by day and almost cool at night.
