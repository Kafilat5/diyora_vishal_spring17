Effective Dec. 22, travelers will be able to take on the plane scissors with blades less than four inches long and screwdrivers less than seven inches long, along with knitting needles, tweezers and nail clippers. (Still banned: box-cutters, knives, hammers and ice picks.) T.S.A. officials said the move was part of a larger effort to focus more on finding explosives, instead of confiscating small items the agency doesn't feel pose a serious threat. In addition, the T.S.A. said it was going to increase the number of random searches of passengers. The development of a Las Vegas-style resort community, the first ever in Spain, is being planned for Ciudad Real, roughly 120 miles south of Madrid. The biggest name attached to the project so far is Harrah's Entertainment, which has just signed up to open a branch of Caesars Palace there by 2008. The planned Caesars complex will include an 850-room hotel, a 50,000-square-foot casino and a 3,000-seat theater. Speaking of Las Vegas, Atlantic City's loss is aparently Sin City's gain. After 84 years on the Jersey Shore, the Miss America pageant will be held in Las Vegas on Jan. 21 at the Aladdin hotel-casino and shown on the Country Music Television cable channel. James Denton, of ''Desperate Housewives,'' will take over the old Bert Parks role, but no word on whether he will end the evening by singing ''There she is .''","abstract":null,"print_page":"2","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Comings and Goings","kicker":"ADVISORY: TRAVEL NOTES"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"TRAVEL AND VACATIONS"}],"pub_date":"2005-12-11T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Travel Desk","section_name":null,"subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd24e268eb7c8105d7efa57","word_count":271,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/abstract.html?res=9C01EFDA123EE23BBC4D53DFB066838C649EDE","snippet":"Govt to permit \u00a3100 travel allowance to be spent in dollars to spur travel in dollar areas...","lead_paragraph":null,"abstract":"Govt to permit \u00a3100 travel allowance to be spent in dollars to spur travel in dollar areas","print_page":"5","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"DOLLAR EXPORT BAN IS EASED BY BRITAIN"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"EUROPE"},{"name":"subject","value":"TRAVEL AND VACATIONS"}],"pub_date":"1957-06-05T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":null,"section_name":null,"subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1}],"original":"Special to The New York Times"},"type_of_material":"Article","_id":"4fc3d4c045c1498b0d895ebd","word_count":128,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/abstract.html?res=9E05E4D91F3CE13BBC4D51DFB766838F669EDE","snippet":"The Justice Department announced today that the Government would not appeal a court decision prohibiting the State Department from requiring applicants for passports to take loyalty oaths....","lead_paragraph":"The Justice Department announced today that the Government would not appeal a court decision prohibiting the State Department from requiring applicants for passports to take loyalty oaths.","abstract":"Justice Dept announces Govt will not appeal Oct '73 decision by US Appeals Ct prohibiting State Dept from requiring applicants for passports to take loyalty oaths; Solicitor Gen Robert H Bork says case will not be taken to Sup Ct because Justice attys have found ruling 'persuasive'; ct concluded that Cong had never given Sec of State sufficient authority to deny passport to anyone who refused to swear allegiance to US; Nixon Adm is not giving up its attempt to require such oaths; Bork repts Justice and State Depts will work together to draft new legis that will give such authority to Sec Kissinger (S)","print_page":"36","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"U.S. WON'T APPEAL LOYALTY OATH BAN"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"UNITED STATES"},{"name":"subject","value":"TRAVEL AND VACATIONS"}],"pub_date":"1974-01-25T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":null,"section_name":null,"subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1}],"original":"Special to The New York Times"},"type_of_material":"Article","_id":"4fc488e045c1498b0da3cd71","word_count":152,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/abstract.html?res=9500E2D8103EE03BBC4152DFB4668382659EDE","snippet":"US transportation cos hail step...","lead_paragraph":null,"abstract":"US transportation cos hail step","print_page":"29","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"End of Japan Travel Ban Hailed"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"TRAVEL AND VACATIONS"}],"pub_date":"1949-02-19T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":null,"section_name":null,"subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1}],"original":"Special to THE NEW YORK TIMES"},"type_of_material":"Article","_id":"4fc3117f45c1498b0d7247d2","word_count":107,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2005\/10\/02\/travel\/02advkorea.html","snippet":"North Korea will allow United States passport holders to enter on visas from either Oct. 8 to 12 or Oct. 15 to 18 to go to the Arirang 2005 festival....","lead_paragraph":"American tourists will have a rare opportunity this month to visit North Korea's capital and see a mass sports festival.
