With the conference nearly wrecked by a procedural dispute last week, the forecast seems to point toward a chill in East-West relations, not surprising, perhaps, with Soviet troops camped in Afghanistan and a new, determined Republican administration about to take over in Washington. But the Madrid meeting, to date, has confounded other predictions. One was that the United States, sounding shrill and self-righteous on human rights and Afghanistan, would alienate its Western European allies, more concerned about salvaging concrete elements of the five-year-old Helsinki accords that are under review here. The Soviet Union would exploit this breach, according to the forecast, sowing further dissension in the Atlantic alliance.","abstract":null,"print_page":"3","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"News Analysis","kicker":"WEST'S UNITY: A TRUMP CARD AT TALKS"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"COMMUNIST-WESTERN RELATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"UNITED STATE INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"CONVENTIONS AND CONFERENCES"}],"pub_date":"1981-06-30T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign Desk","section_name":"World","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1}],"original":"By JAMES M.
