Although the case involves only a single count of obstruction of justice, the steady flow of clients bolting to find a new auditor is likely to become a tidal wave. The Justice Department's move, extraordinarily swift and severe, befits the significance of the case and the urgent need to shore up public confidence in the integrity of financial markets. This and any subsequent criminal charges filed against Enron principals, however, should not detract Congress from the need to press ahead with major reforms of accounting and corporate practices.","abstract":"Editorial on Justice Department's extraordinarily swift, severe action against Arthur Andersen, first major accounting firm ever indicted, as result of its role in demise of Enron Corp; suggests Congress study Paul Volcker's proposal for saving company as blueprintfor reforming industry","print_page":"14","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"The First Enron Indictment"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"VOLCKER, PAUL"},{"name":"glocations","value":"UNITED STATES"},{"name":"organizations","value":"JUSTICE DEPARTMENT"},{"name":"organizations","value":"ENRON CORP"},{"name":"organizations","value":"ANDERSEN, ARTHUR, & CO"},{"name":"subject","value":"FRAUDS AND SWINDLING"},{"name":"subject","value":"ACCOUNTING AND ACCOUNTANTS"},{"name":"subject","value":"EDITORIALS"},{"name":"subject","value":"ETHICS"},{"name":"subject","value":"LAW AND LEGISLATION"},{"name":"subject","value":"REGULATION AND DEREGULATION OF INDUSTRY"},{"name":"subject","value":"BANKRUPTCIES"}],"pub_date":"2002-03-16T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Editorial Desk","section_name":"Opinion","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Editorial","_id":"4fd265978eb7c8105d819a3e","word_count":341,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2002\/01\/20\/weekinreview\/january-13-19-economy-enron-scandal-deepens.html","snippet":"It didn't seem like the scandal surrounding the collapse of the Enron Corporation could get any worse.

Then it did. In a flood of revelations, documents were released from a Congressional committee showing that the company's chairman had received an anonymous letter from an employee in August, giving him a heads-up on the problems at Enron months before the company unraveled. The chairman, Kenneth L. Lay, ordered a legal review, while still chatting up the prospects for the company's stock. Then, the company's auditors, Arthur Andersen & Company, fired the partner who handled the Enron account, saying that he had led an effort to destroy documents in the days after the Securities and Exchange Commission requested documents from the company. And there doesn't seem to be an end in sight.
