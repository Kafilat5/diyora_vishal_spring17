That is the day the resort, one of the few holdouts in the United States, ends its ban. At the same time, adult lift tickets will be reduced to $29 from $65 a day between March 31 and April 22; there is a minimum purchase of two days' worth of tickets, and they must be ordered by Thursday. During this period, called Spring Jam, the ski area will also offer live music and D.J.'s at outdoor apr\u00e8s-ski parties. The Aspen Skiing Company, which operates three other ski areas nearby -- Buttermilk, Snowmass and Aspen Highlands, all of which already permit snowboarders -- decided to open Aspen Mountain to snowboarders because it no longer wanted to split families and because it thought that the future of the industry demanded it, said Rose Abello, director of communications. ''Kids under 18 are 50 percent of snowboarders,'' she said.","abstract":"Aspen Mountain in Colorado will allow snowboarding for first time; photo (S)","print_page":"3","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Aspen Mountain: A Holdout No Longer","kicker":"TRAVEL ADVISORY"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"COLORADO"},{"name":"glocations","value":"ASPEN (COLO)"},{"name":"subject","value":"SKIING"},{"name":"subject","value":"SNOWBOARDING"}],"pub_date":"2001-03-18T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Travel Desk","section_name":null,"subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"John","middlename":"Brannon","lastname":"ALBRIGHT","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By JOHN BRANNON ALBRIGHT"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd2471a8eb7c8105d7e27e2","word_count":216,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1995\/07\/02\/travel\/travel-advisory-no-smoking-law-takes-full-effect-in-vermont.html","snippet":"Smoking is prohibited starting this month in restaurants, bars and the common areas of hotels and motels in Vermont.

These establishments had been given a two-year grace period under the state's Clean Indoor Air Act, which went into effect in July of 1993 and outlawed smoking in most places of business. There are 3,500 to 4,000 restaurants in Vermont, according to the state's Department of Health. Only establishments licensed as cabarets by the state's Department of Liquor Control are exempt from the smoking ban. As a result, the number of cabaret licenses in Vermont has more than doubled in recent months. For the last license year, May 1994 through April 1995, the department issued about 80 full-year cabaret licenses. In the last two months, more than 200 restaurants have been issued the licenses. Cabarets must receive less than half of their receipts from the sale of food.","abstract":null,"print_page":"3","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"No-Smoking Law Takes Full Effect in Vermont","kicker":"TRAVEL ADVISORY"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"VERMONT"},{"name":"subject","value":"BARS"},{"name":"subject","value":"RESTAURANTS"},{"name":"subject","value":"HOTELS AND MOTELS"},{"name":"subject","value":"LAW AND LEGISLATION"},{"name":"subject","value":"SMOKING AND TOBACCO"},{"name":"subject","value":"NYTRAVEL"}],"pub_date":"1995-07-02T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Travel Desk","section_name":null,"subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd1ce2b8eb7c8105d705e81","word_count":159,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1992\/01\/26\/travel\/travel-advisory-tanzania-bans-camping-in-crater.html","snippet":"Tour companies that operate safaris in East Africa have been informed by the Tanzanian Government that it has decided to end tented camping on the floor of the Ngorongoro Crater, where for years tourists have gone to sleep listening to the calls o...","lead_paragraph":"Tour companies that operate safaris in East Africa have been informed by the Tanzanian Government that it has decided to end tented camping on the floor of the Ngorongoro Crater, where for years tourists have gone to sleep listening to the calls of distant lion and hyena. No official statement has been issued by the Tanzanians, except that the ban begins March 31, but tour operators say they assume the reason for the decision is to protect the crater's ecology. Camping on Ngorongoro's circular floor, which is 2,000 feet below the 7,000-foot-high rim, has been a highlight of some safari tours for many years. The floor covers about 125 square miles, with a lake and forests, and has a resident animal population that includes elephant, wildebeest, monkeys and hippopotamus. There are lodges and camping sites on the rim, and visitors will continue to go down into the crater on half-day and day game-viewing trips from these.","abstract":null,"print_page":"3","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Tanzania Bans Camping In Crater","kicker":"TRAVEL ADVISORY"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"TANZANIA"},{"name":"glocations","value":"NGORONGORO CRATER (TANZANIA)"},{"name":"subject","value":"CAMPS AND CAMPING"},{"name":"subject","value":"SAFARIS"},{"name":"subject","value":"NYTRAVEL"}],"pub_date":"1992-01-26T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Travel Desk","section_name":null,"subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd1ac108eb7c8105d6cae32","word_count":247,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/reuters\/2017\/02\/20\/world\/middleeast\/20reuters-canada-politics-refugees.html","snippet":"One in four Canadians say Ottawa should have adopted a temporary halt on Syrian refugees in response to the United States' controversial travel ban, though the majority supported the government's current immigration plan, an Angus Reid Institute p...","lead_paragraph":"One in four Canadians say Ottawa should have adopted a temporary halt on Syrian refugees in response to the United States' controversial travel ban, though the majority supported the government's current immigration plan, an Angus Reid Institute poll showed on Monday.","abstract":null,"print_page":0,"blog":[],"source":"Reuters","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"One in Four Canadians Support Temporary Refugee Ban: Poll","print_headline":"One in Four Canadians Support Temporary Refugee Ban: Poll"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2017-02-20T08:06:28+0000","document_type":"article","news_desk":"None","section_name":"World","subsection_name":"Middle East","byline":{"person":[],"original":"By REUTERS","organization":"REUTERS"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"58aaa38e95d0e02474637881","word_count":330,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2014\/10\/21\/business\/for-travel-pros-ebola-fears-create-teaching-moments.html","snippet":"The effects in the business travel industry have been negligible so far, but concerns are growing....","lead_paragraph":"The effects in the business travel industry have been negligible so far, but concerns are growing.","abstract":"Joe Sharkey On the Road column notes that while effects of Ebola outbreak on business travel industry have been negligible so far, concerns are growing.","print_page":"8","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"width":190,"url":"images\/2014\/10\/21\/business\/Road\/Road-thumbWide.jpg","height":126,"subtype":"wide","legacy":{"wide":"images\/2014\/10\/21\/business\/Road\/Road-thumbWide.jpg","wideheight":"126","widewidth":"190"},"type":"image"},{"width":600,"url":"images\/2014\/10\/21\/business\/Road\/Road-articleLarge.jpg","height":708,"subtype":"xlarge","legacy":{"xlargewidth":"600","xlarge":"images\/2014\/10\/21\/business\/Road\/Road-articleLarge.jpg","xlargeheight":"708"},"type":"image"},{"width":75,"url":"images\/2014\/10\/21\/business\/Road\/Road-thumbStandard.jpg","height":75,"subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"thumbnailheight":"75","thumbnail":"images\/2014\/10\/21\/business\/Road\/Road-thumbStandard.jpg","thumbnailwidth":"75"},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"For Travel Pros, Ebola Fears Create Teaching Moments","content_kicker":"On the Road","kicker":"On the Road","print_headline":"For Travel Pros, Ebola Fears Create Teaching Moments"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","is_major":"Y","name":"subject","value":"Ebola Virus"},{"rank":"2","is_major":"Y","name":"subject","value":"Business Travel"},{"rank":"3","is_major":"N","name":"subject","value":"Travel Warnings"},{"rank":"4","is_major":"N","name":"organizations","value":"Global Business Travel Assn"}],"pub_date":"2014-10-21T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Business","section_name":"Business Day","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"contributor":"","person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Joe","rank":1,"lastname":"SHARKEY"}],"original":"By JOE SHARKEY"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"544586c738f0d832c813ee4c","word_count":"935","slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1994\/10\/02\/travel\/travel-advisory-us-bans-airlines-from-nine-countries.html","snippet":"The Department of Transportation has announced it is prohibiting airlines from nine countries from flying to the United States because the countries do not meet international safety standards.
