Fastow and urged the company to ''come clean'' about the risks they posed. The witness, Vince Kaminski, who led a team of more than 50 quantitative specialists at Enron, said he saw a conflict of interest in the LJM partnership set up by Mr. Fastow, Enron's former chief financial officer. Mr. Kaminski also said he told a senior manager that an idea to hedge an investment in an Internet start-up would create a credit risk that could threaten Enron's health.","abstract":"Vince Kaminski, former Enron managing director who evaluated risk for company, testifies that he strenuously objected to formation of off-balance-sheet partnerships directed by Andrew S Fastow and urged company to 'come clean' about risks they posed; says he saw conflict of interest in LJM partnership set up by Fastow; former employee Christopher Loehr also testifies in seventh week of trial of former Enron chief executive Jeffrey K Skilling and founder Kenneth L Lay; photo (M)","print_page":"5","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Ex-Enron Officer Says He Warned of Shady Partnerships"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"KAMINSKI, VINCE"},{"name":"persons","value":"LOEHR, CHRISTOPHER"},{"name":"persons","value":"FASTOW, ANDREW S"},{"name":"persons","value":"SKILLING, JEFFREY K"},{"name":"organizations","value":"ENRON CORPORATION"},{"name":"organizations","value":"ENRON CORP"},{"name":"organizations","value":"LJM1"},{"name":"subject","value":"FRAUDS AND SWINDLING"},{"name":"subject","value":"ACCOUNTING AND ACCOUNTANTS"},{"name":"subject","value":"SECURITIES AND COMMODITIES VIOLATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"ETHICS"},{"name":"subject","value":"BANKRUPTCIES"}],"pub_date":"2006-03-15T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Business\/Financial Desk","section_name":"Business","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Alexei","lastname":"BARRIONUEVO"}],"original":"By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd2ab7f8eb7c8105d8984e2","word_count":1021,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1987\/10\/23\/business\/company-news-enron-to-close-unit-after-costly-trades.html","snippet":"LEAD: The Enron Corporation said today that it would permanently close its Enron Oil Corporation subsidiary after learning that the unit had lost $85 million because of unauthorized trading in the petroleum futures markets....","lead_paragraph":"LEAD: The Enron Corporation said today that it would permanently close its Enron Oil Corporation subsidiary after learning that the unit had lost $85 million because of unauthorized trading in the petroleum futures markets.","abstract":null,"print_page":"5","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Enron to Close Unit After Costly Trades","kicker":"COMPANY NEWS"},"keywords":[{"name":"organizations","value":"ENRON CORP"},{"name":"organizations","value":"ENRON OIL CORP"},{"name":"subject","value":"SUSPENSIONS, DISMISSALS AND RESIGNATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"SHUTDOWNS (INSTITUTIONAL)"},{"name":"subject","value":"FINANCES"},{"name":"subject","value":"FUTURES TRADING"}],"pub_date":"1987-10-23T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Financial Desk","section_name":"Business","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"Peter","middlename":"H.","lastname":"FRANK","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""},{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":2}],"original":"By PETER H.
