These flashes could merely have been bubbles bursting, or they might have been something far greater -- glimpses of the future. Historically, innovative ideas are incorporated into the economic system only through a painful shakedown process. Often, these new ideas have signaled a sea change in the economic order of things, but the system often readjusted only after a brutal upheaval.","abstract":"Enron Corp's collapse does not diminish merits of business model it pioneered: online exchange where financial bets, not assets, back trading in energy and natural gas; drawing (M)","print_page":"6","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"The Nation; Finding Gems of Genius Among Enron's Crumbs"},"keywords":[{"name":"organizations","value":"ENRON CORP"},{"name":"subject","value":"GAS (FUEL)"},{"name":"subject","value":"FINANCES"},{"name":"subject","value":"ELECTRIC LIGHT AND POWER"},{"name":"subject","value":"BANKRUPTCIES"},{"name":"subject","value":"COMPUTERS AND THE INTERNET"}],"pub_date":"2002-02-03T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Week in Review Desk","section_name":"Technology; Week in Review","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Daniel","rank":1,"lastname":"ALTMAN"}],"original":"By DANIEL ALTMAN"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd219658eb7c8105d797661","word_count":1061,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2002\/01\/30\/opinion\/l-no-respite-in-the-enron-furor-376027.html","snippet":"To the Editor:    Will the Enron scandal (front page, Jan. 29) make those in Congress who favor a stock market-based system for Social Security think again?

The moment seemed ripe for a familiar flourish of indignation and versification.
