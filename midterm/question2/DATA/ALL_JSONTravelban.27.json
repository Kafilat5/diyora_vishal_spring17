The move allows American companies to arrange transportation to Cambodia and organize tours and conduct business there, activities that were previously banned. Another limitation removed was a ceiling of $200 that Americans could spend per day after arranging a visit through a third country. Cambodia's major attraction is its ancient temples, particularly the Angkor temple complex near Siemreap. Most tourists go on day trips by air to the temples. Despite the Treasury announcement, the State Department is maintaining a warning discouraging trips to Cambodia because of military activity, hidden land mines and \"widespread banditry\" near tourist sites. The United States does not have full embassy and consular operations in Cambodia.","abstract":null,"print_page":"3","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Treasury Lifts Cambodia Ban","kicker":"TRAVEL ADVISORY"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"CAMBODIA"},{"name":"organizations","value":"TREASURY DEPARTMENT"},{"name":"subject","value":"UNITED STATES INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"CURRENCY"},{"name":"subject","value":"NYTRAVEL"},{"name":"subject","value":"TRAVEL AND VACATIONS"}],"pub_date":"1992-02-09T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Travel Desk","section_name":"Washington","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd19ee08eb7c8105d6b20bd","word_count":237,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/01\/30\/opinion\/diplomats-decry-muslim-ban.html","snippet":"More than 100 State Department employees are expected to sign a memo conveying their opposition to the travel ban....","lead_paragraph":"More than 100 State Department employees are expected to sign a memo conveying their opposition to the travel ban.","abstract":null,"print_page":"28","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"width":190,"url":"images\/2017\/01\/31\/opinion\/31tue2web\/31tue2web-thumbWide.jpg","height":126,"subtype":"wide","legacy":{"wide":"images\/2017\/01\/31\/opinion\/31tue2web\/31tue2web-thumbWide.jpg","wideheight":"126","widewidth":"190"},"type":"image"},{"width":600,"url":"images\/2017\/01\/31\/opinion\/31tue2web\/31tue2web-articleLarge.jpg","height":400,"subtype":"xlarge","legacy":{"xlargewidth":"600","xlarge":"images\/2017\/01\/31\/opinion\/31tue2web\/31tue2web-articleLarge.jpg","xlargeheight":"400"},"type":"image"},{"width":75,"url":"images\/2017\/01\/31\/opinion\/31tue2web\/31tue2web-thumbStandard.jpg","height":75,"subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"thumbnailheight":"75","thumbnail":"images\/2017\/01\/31\/opinion\/31tue2web\/31tue2web-thumbStandard.jpg","thumbnailwidth":"75"},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"Diplomats Decry Muslim Ban","content_kicker":"Editorial","kicker":"Editorial","print_headline":"Diplomats Decry Muslim Ban"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","is_major":"N","name":"subject","value":"United States International Relations"},{"rank":"2","is_major":"N","name":"subject","value":"United States Politics and Government"},{"rank":"3","is_major":"N","name":"subject","value":"Diplomatic Service, Embassies and Consulates"},{"rank":"4","is_major":"N","name":"organizations","value":"State Department"},{"rank":"5","is_major":"N","name":"persons","value":"Trump, Donald J"},{"rank":"6","is_major":"N","name":"subject","value":"Refugees and Displaced Persons"},{"rank":"7","is_major":"N","name":"subject","value":"Immigration and Emigration"},{"rank":"8","is_major":"N","name":"subject","value":"Executive Orders and Memorandums"},{"rank":"9","is_major":"N","name":"subject","value":"Muslims and Islam"}],"pub_date":"2017-01-31T02:15:49+0000","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Editorial","section_name":"Opinion","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[],"original":"By THE EDITORIAL BOARD","organization":"THE EDITORIAL BOARD"},"type_of_material":"Editorial","_id":"588ff35e95d0e0392607daac","word_count":"374","slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/abstract.html?res=9D02E5DA1039E53ABC4953DFB266838D659EDE","snippet":"ZURICH, Switzerland, March 31 --Following resumption of diplomatic relations with Switzerland, the Soviet Union is not losing a single moment in exploiting the, opportunity arising out of the Washington ......","lead_paragraph":"ZURICH, Switzerland, March 31 --Following resumption of diplomatic relations with Switzerland, the Soviet Union is not losing a single moment in exploiting the, opportunity arising out of the Washington ...","abstract":"Debt to USSR linked with Hungary's purchases in Switzerland","print_page":"4","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"SOVIET SATELLITES SEEK SWISS TRADE;
