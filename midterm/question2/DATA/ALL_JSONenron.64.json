The stock had fallen on rumors that Enron would lay off up to 11 traders after it was hurt by a surge in natural gas futures prices this week. It rose $2.375, to $37.375, in Big Board trading of almost 1.2 million shares, after sliding $2.625 on Thursday. The Houston-based company said the move reaffirmed its confidence in its operations, including the trading operations within its Enron Capital and Trade Resources unit. The company also said it expected to meet earnings and cash flow targets.","abstract":null,"print_page":"41","blog":[],"source":"Reuters","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"BUYBACK OF SHARES SET TO OFFSET DROP IN STOCK","kicker":"COMPANY NEWS"},"keywords":[{"name":"organizations","value":"ENRON CORP"}],"pub_date":"1995-12-23T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Business\/Financial Desk","section_name":"Business","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"organization":"Reuters","original":"Reuters","person":[]},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd1ece88eb7c8105d73e8cf","word_count":117,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1995\/08\/15\/business\/international-briefs-lawyers-will-not-help-india-state-fight-enron.html","snippet":"Lawyers for the government of the Indian state of Maharashtra said yesterday that they would not represent it in its dispute with the Enron Corporation because they would have to argue against a contract they had previously declared valid.

They will ask to be released on bail so that they can return to Britain to prepare their cases, Mr. Spragg said.
