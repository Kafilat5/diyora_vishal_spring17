Corporate directors are newly empowered, and in many cases a lot better paid than they were in the old days. Auditors are more closely regulated, but in ways that have improved their income significantly. Wall Street's way of doing stock research has been turned around. Corporate officials must now personally certify their companies' financial results and the quality of the internal controls that assure accuracy.
