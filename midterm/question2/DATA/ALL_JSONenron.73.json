In just the last year, Enron signed billions of dollars' worth of long-term energy management contracts. Under those contracts, Enron generally pledged to provide its customers with electricity and natural gas, maintain generating, heating and cooling equipment, pursue conservation measures and protect against swings in energy prices. In November last year, the Macerich Company, based in Santa Monica, Calif., signed a 10-year agreement with Enron to provide electricity and natural gas for the 51 shopping malls it owns or operates, including the Queens Center, in Elmhurst, and the Redmond Town Center near Seattle. Then, Arthur Coppola, Macerich's president and chief executive, hailed the agreement, worth about $15 million a year, as a way to tame the volatility of energy prices.","abstract":"Enron's collapse leaves its 28,500 business customers having to look elsewhere for nautral gas, electricity and paper mill products; customers range from shopping malls to factories to newspapers (M)","print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Energy Customers; With a Manager Gone, Gaps to Be Bridged"},"keywords":[{"name":"organizations","value":"ENRON CORP"},{"name":"subject","value":"GAS (FUEL)"},{"name":"subject","value":"NEWSPRINT"},{"name":"subject","value":"ELECTRIC LIGHT AND POWER"}],"pub_date":"2001-12-02T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Money and Business\/Financial Desk","section_name":"Business","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Micheline","rank":1,"lastname":"MAYNARD"}],"original":"By MICHELINE MAYNARD"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd2124b8eb7c8105d788669","word_count":511,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2001\/12\/02\/business\/market-watch-beware-those-one-note-401-k-s.html","snippet":"OF all the scenes from the Enron train wreck, none is more disturbing than that of the workers dazed by the realization that their retirement plans have been destroyed by the plunge of their company's once highflying stock.

O.K., not exactly. Kenneth Lay, chairman of Enron, was a prime mover in George W. Bush's presidential campaign; he has also been an influential voice in favor of electricity deregulation, and Enron is profiting handsomely from the electricity it sells in California. But what he actually said was that California's power consumers ''need to see the price signals [that is, pay much more] and start modifying behavior to reduce demand until we get new supplies.'' He also rejected the plea of California officials for a federally imposed cap on wholesale electricity prices, arguing that this would merely ''start spreading the shortage around.''
