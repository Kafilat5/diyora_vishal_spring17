For several years, Mexico City's ''Green Angels'' have patroled the highways in green trucks looking for motorists who need help changing a tire or replacing a broken fan belt. The two patrols' functions are complementary, according to an official of the Mexican National Tourist Council. The Green Angels are equipped to perform minor auto repairs and are trained to provide first-aid if required. The Silver Angels,''who provide protection and assistance,'' the tourist council said, deal with more serious problems like accidents, illness and lost property. He also conceded that the new squad might serve as a deterrent to thieves preying on tourists. A visitor who needs help from either of the patrols should telephone 588-51-00.

Unlike Pattaya, the overbuilt mainland resort nearby, most of Koh Samet has been protected as a national park since 1981, with a ban on new building, and hotels and bungalows largely hidden behind trees. Shaped roughly like a miniature South America, Koh Samet has as its main attraction a series of bays, separated by rocky outcrops, that dot the length of the island's east side. Each has its own characteristics, but all have fine, squeaky white sand and azure waters. The island gets almost equal numbers of Thai and foreign visitors, and so it also provides a taste of how Thai people vacation sanuk-style -- ''sanuk'' being a Thai word that loosely means fun. On Koh Samet, it generally means crowds of families or students, appointed with hats, guitars, picnic baskets, whisky and all the flotsam of a stay at the beach. Many of them stay at family-style resorts at the most popular beach, Hat Sai Kaew, or camp out along the coast.","abstract":"Martha Stevenson Olson travel article on Koh Samet, Thailand; photos (L)","print_page":"10","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Island Escape From Bangkok","kicker":"ASIA-PACIFIC ISSUE"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"THAILAND"},{"name":"glocations","value":"KOH SAMET (THAILAND)"},{"name":"subject","value":"TRAVEL AND VACATIONS"}],"pub_date":"1997-04-20T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Travel Desk","section_name":"Travel","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"Martha","middlename":"Stevenson","lastname":"OLSON","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By MARTHA STEVENSON OLSON"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd1f83d8eb7c8105d75454b","word_count":2242,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1987\/09\/20\/world\/north-korea-tourism-signals-new-openness.html","snippet":"LEAD: North Korea, one of the most reclusive countries in the world, is trying to develop a tourist industry and open a little more to the West, according to diplomats, tour operators, business executives and some North Koreans themselves....","lead_paragraph":"LEAD: North Korea, one of the most reclusive countries in the world, is trying to develop a tourist industry and open a little more to the West, according to diplomats, tour operators, business executives and some North Koreans themselves.","abstract":null,"print_page":"12","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"North Korea Tourism Signals New Openness"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"NORTH KOREA"},{"name":"subject","value":"TRAVEL AND VACATIONS"}],"pub_date":"1987-09-20T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign Desk","section_name":"World","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1}],"original":"By NICHOLAS D.
