One of the fired employees, Clayton Vernon, had asked Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman, during an earlier internal online discussion whether Enron had used aggressive accounting to overstate its profits. It is unclear whether Mr. Vernon's question to Mr. Lay, which came in September, two months before he was dismissed, played any role in his firing. But a coarsely worded message critical of Mr. Lay that Mr. Vernon posted in November under a screen alias was traced back to him in less than a day.","abstract":"Enron Corp dismissed at least two employees in last two months for posting online information or negative opinions about company; Clayton Vernon had earlier asked chairman Kenneth Lay in online discussion whether Enron used aggressive accounting to overstate profits; second employee revealed in December that Enron paid $55 million in retention bonuses to executives just before filing for bankruptcy and laying off 4,000 workers; Enron declines comment on firings (M)","print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Enron Fired Workers for Complaining Online","kicker":"ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE ANGER"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"VERNON, CLAYTON"},{"name":"persons","value":"LAY, KENNETH L"},{"name":"organizations","value":"ENRON CORP"},{"name":"subject","value":"SUSPENSIONS, DISMISSALS AND RESIGNATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"FRAUDS AND SWINDLING"},{"name":"subject","value":"LABOR"},{"name":"subject","value":"ETHICS"},{"name":"subject","value":"BONUSES"},{"name":"subject","value":"COMPUTERS AND THE INTERNET"},{"name":"subject","value":"BANKRUPTCIES"}],"pub_date":"2002-01-21T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Business\/Financial Desk","section_name":"Technology; Business","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Alex","rank":1,"lastname":"BERENSON"}],"original":"By ALEX BERENSON"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd212448eb7c8105d7880fe","word_count":1032,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2002\/01\/15\/business\/enron-s-collapse-the-response-democrats-ponder-how-wide-a-net-to-cast.html","snippet":"Seven months ago, when he took over as chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, Senator Joseph I.

Lieberman said he would examine the ''serious allegations'' raised by a colleague from California about the relationship between the Enron Corporation and one of its chief Washington regulators.

The company's contacts and influence in the White House and Congress bred envy among competitors. It was a driving force behind a radical shift in the nation's energy policy, and its fortune seemed guaranteed for years.

Bush has a great advantage. Having watched what happened to his predecessor, he should understand the importance of simply making everyone tell the truth right away. It is going too far at the moment to call the collapse of Enron a scandal for the Bush administration. The head of Enron was one of the president's biggest campaign donors, and we now know that he called two cabinet officers last fall to warn them that the company was in terrible trouble. But none of that was necessarily improper, and there is no indication that those calls or other conversations between Enron executives and administration officials led to any action by the government.","abstract":"Editorial says collapse of Enron Corp cannot be called scandal for Bush administration, but that has not stopped Pres Bush from trying to sidestep Enron connections to his administration, however proper they were; says Bush can prevent any taint from spreading by ordering administration members to cooperate with all relevant investigations into Enron and extent to which it has influenced administration energy policies","print_page":"14","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Minimizing the Enron Taint"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"BUSH, GEORGE W"},{"name":"organizations","value":"ENRON CORP"},{"name":"subject","value":"ACCOUNTING AND ACCOUNTANTS"},{"name":"subject","value":"EDITORIALS"},{"name":"subject","value":"ETHICS"},{"name":"subject","value":"BANKRUPTCIES"}],"pub_date":"2002-01-12T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Editorial Desk","section_name":"Opinion","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Editorial","_id":"4fd22cbc8eb7c8105d7b91d2","word_count":545,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2001\/12\/30\/business\/even-the-smartest-money-can-slip-up.html","snippet":"''The more intense the craze, the higher the type of intellect that succumbs to it.''
