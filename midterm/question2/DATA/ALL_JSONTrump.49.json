Sadly, many have agreed with him and have thought that my foray into presidential politics was done for the purpose of further heightening the Trump name, helping to sell my new book and building even greater awareness of my various real estate developments. That, however, is not the case. I seriously thought that America might be ready for a businessman president, someone with an eye for the bottom line, someone who has created thousands of jobs and isn't part of the ''inside the Beltway'' buddy system. I also thought that Americans might be ready for straight talk and that they would find an unscripted candidate appealing.","abstract":"Op-Ed article by Donald J Trump explains why he considered running for president, and why he decided to withdraw; says he thought America might be ready for businessman president, someone not part of 'inside the Beltway' buddy system; says he chose Reform Party because its nomination process does not involve long string of early primaries, and because of his admiration for Gov Jesse Ventura; says many in Reform Party impress him, but party also has fringe element he finds distasteful; says Commission on Presidential Debates produced debate criteria designed to keep Reform Party's candidate out of fall debates; says, finally, that fratricide in national Reform Party drove Ventura out of party; says he has not ruled out another bid for presidency in 2004 (M)","print_page":"15","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"What I Saw at the Revolution"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"VENTURA, JESSE"},{"name":"organizations","value":"REFORM PARTY"},{"name":"subject","value":"DEBATING"},{"name":"subject","value":"PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 2000"},{"name":"subject","value":"PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 2004"}],"pub_date":"2000-02-19T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Editorial Desk","section_name":"Opinion","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"Donald","middlename":"J.","lastname":"Trump","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By Donald J.
