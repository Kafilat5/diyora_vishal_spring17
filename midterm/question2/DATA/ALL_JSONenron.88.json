This is a scandal with a very broad reach and it has some of the wise guys in the Bush administration and other top Republicans trembling in their penny loafers. Enron was a bonanza for -- whom else? -- the folks at the top of the pyramid. They ferociously exploited their gilt-edged political connections and harvested breathtaking amounts of cash for themselves, even as the company was collapsing into the biggest bankruptcy mess in U.S. history. Left behind were thousands of ordinary working men and women, people with families and obligations, who lost jobs, life savings, pensions, the works. And more carnage is to come.","abstract":"Bob Herbert Op-Ed column says collapse of Enron is case study in dangers that will inevitably arise when unrestrained corporate greed is 'joined at the hip' with 'legalized bribery and influence-peddling' that 'currently passes for government'; accuses Enron executives of ferociously exploiting 'gilt-edged' political connections with Bush administration, harvesting large amounts of cash for themselves, even as company was collapsing into biggest bankruptcy mess in US history (M)","print_page":"27","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Joined at the Hip"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"BUSH, GEORGE W"},{"name":"organizations","value":"ENRON CORP"},{"name":"subject","value":"ETHICS"},{"name":"subject","value":"ELECTRIC LIGHT AND POWER"},{"name":"subject","value":"LOBBYING AND LOBBYISTS"},{"name":"subject","value":"BANKRUPTCIES"}],"pub_date":"2002-01-10T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Editorial Desk","section_name":"Opinion","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Bob","rank":1,"lastname":"HERBERT"}],"original":"By BOB HERBERT"},"type_of_material":"Op-Ed","_id":"4fd26bde8eb7c8105d8243a7","word_count":715,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2001\/12\/02\/weekinreview\/fate-s-ups-and-downs.html","snippet":"A YEAR ago this week, George W.
