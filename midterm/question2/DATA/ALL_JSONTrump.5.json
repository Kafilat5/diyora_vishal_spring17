Tears rolling down their cheeks, they couldn't stop laughing or keep their contagion of chuckles from spreading to almost half the other girls at their boarding school. Some fits were lasting minutes, others hours, some up to 16 days, until exasperated administrators closed the school five months later. Afflicted girls were sent home to their villages around Lake Victoria, where they duly infected more children and young adults with their ''sickness.'' Before the epidemic finally relented, in 1964, it forced the temporary closing of more than 14 schools, all because of unstoppable laughter. What was so funny no one ever discovered, but the mirth gathered a momentum that caught hundreds of unsuspecting villagers in its riptide. At the time, it was considered a pathology to be quarantined and quashed. But today, this unmoored laughter is celebrated in over 1,000 laughter clubs worldwide as a therapy to reduce stress, lower blood pressure, strengthen the immune system and perhaps even lead to world peace.","abstract":"Laughter clubs are springing up worldwide as a therapy to reduce stress, lower blood pressure, strengthen immune system and confer other benefits; photo (MP","print_page":"7","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Got the Giggles?
