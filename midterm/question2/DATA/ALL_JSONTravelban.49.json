Passengers can check two pieces of baggage, each with a maximum weight of 50 pounds, for no charge, the same as for domestic flights. Starting Sept. 7, passengers to most destinations will be charged $25 for each bag weighing more than 50 pounds, but less than 70. The charge for a bag between 70 and 100 pounds to most destinations is $75. Information: (800)523-3273 or www.continental.com. SWEDEN has become the latest European country to ban smoking in its cafes, restaurants and nightclubs, joining Ireland, Italy, Malta, Montenegro, and Norway. Now, 21-year-olds can rent a car from AVIS or BUDGET, although they must pay an additional $25 a day. The new policy from Avis and Budget lowers the minimum age to rent a car from 25 to 21 in most locations. In Washington, D.C.; Connecticut; Idaho; Iowa; and northwestern New Jersey (including Newark Airport), renters still must be at least 25. And in New York, the old rules still apply: drivers between 18 and 24 are charged an additional $110 each day at Avis and an additional $115 at Budget.

Effective Dec. 22, travelers will be able to take on the plane scissors with blades less than four inches long and screwdrivers less than seven inches long, along with knitting needles, tweezers and nail clippers. (Still banned: box-cutters, knives, hammers and ice picks.) T.S.A. officials said the move was part of a larger effort to focus more on finding explosives, instead of confiscating small items the agency doesn't feel pose a serious threat. In addition, the T.S.A. said it was going to increase the number of random searches of passengers. The development of a Las Vegas-style resort community, the first ever in Spain, is being planned for Ciudad Real, roughly 120 miles south of Madrid. The biggest name attached to the project so far is Harrah's Entertainment, which has just signed up to open a branch of Caesars Palace there by 2008. The planned Caesars complex will include an 850-room hotel, a 50,000-square-foot casino and a 3,000-seat theater. Speaking of Las Vegas, Atlantic City's loss is aparently Sin City's gain. After 84 years on the Jersey Shore, the Miss America pageant will be held in Las Vegas on Jan. 21 at the Aladdin hotel-casino and shown on the Country Music Television cable channel. James Denton, of ''Desperate Housewives,'' will take over the old Bert Parks role, but no word on whether he will end the evening by singing ''There she is .''","abstract":null,"print_page":"2","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Comings and Goings","kicker":"ADVISORY: TRAVEL NOTES"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"TRAVEL AND VACATIONS"}],"pub_date":"2005-12-11T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Travel Desk","section_name":null,"subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd24e268eb7c8105d7efa57","word_count":271,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/abstract.html?res=9A0DE4DF1E30EF3BBC4A53DFB4678388679EDE","snippet":"lifts ban on foreigners travel to 8 eastern provs; map...","lead_paragraph":null,"abstract":"lifts ban on foreigners travel to 8 eastern provs; map","print_page":"5","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Turkey Lifts Travel Ban in East"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"EUROPE"},{"name":"subject","value":"TRAVEL AND VACATIONS"}],"pub_date":"1963-12-02T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":null,"section_name":null,"subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Article","_id":"4fc4197545c1498b0d91112d","word_count":144,"slideshow_credits":null}]},"status":"OK","copyright":"Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
