If Ms. Kaufman was seeking a less structured holiday, however, she might have tried an expedition to Northeast Thailand. A friend and I spent several days in January driving through Esarn, as the region is known in Thailand. The people in this area are ethnically Lao and speak a language that is similar to but distinct from Thai. Khonkaen, in the center of Esarn, is one of Thailand's largest cities, and although it is linked to Bangkok by daily air service and an adequate telephone system, an English speaker finds it difficult to communicate effectively. The city serves as an excellent jumping-off point for further exploration of the Northeast; the Mekong River and the border with Laos are three hours to the north and the archeological site at Ban Chiang is nearby. As guided tours are generally not available, such excursions require significant individual initiative; a rental car is quite useful. We visited Phimai, an Angkor-period Khmer temple complex, and found not a tour bus in sight and only a marginally comprehensible English brochure to guide us through the nearly deserted runs.
