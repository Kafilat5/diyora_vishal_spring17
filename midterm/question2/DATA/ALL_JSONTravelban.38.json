But one of the features it is most proud of is the paper doors. Coated in beeswax and flame proofing, formed into honeycomb-structured sheets, the paper becomes strong enough to use as building material for cabinets and wall partitions, but still light enough to keep a jet within its weight limit. Topped with a thin sheet of sycamore and eight coats of varnish, the glossy panels fit nicely into the goal of feather-light opulence, as do rare-wood veneers, faux-marble counters and 24-karat gold-plated seat belts. When the aim is to cruise at 30,000 feet, the facade often becomes more valuable -- and more expensive -- than the real thing.","abstract":"Article on Lufthansa Technik, German company that specializes in luxury interiors for large private jets; says Lufthansa Technik is currently working on Boeing Business Jet 2; holds while Boeing originally estimated basic cost of interior for its Boeing Business Jet at around $7.5 million, some customers have exceeded that by $10 million; photo (M)","print_page":"8","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Luxury Jet Outfitters Help Their Clients Live Large","kicker":"BUSINESS TRAVEL"},"keywords":[{"name":"organizations","value":"BOEING CO"},{"name":"organizations","value":"LUFTHANSA TECHNIK AG"},{"name":"subject","value":"AIRLINES AND AIRPLANES"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERIOR DESIGN"}],"pub_date":"2002-06-25T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Business\/Financial Desk","section_name":"Business","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Julie","rank":1,"lastname":"FLAHERTY"}],"original":"By JULIE FLAHERTY"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd27f5c8eb7c8105d8496c5","word_count":1212,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/aponline\/2017\/02\/07\/us\/politics\/ap-us-congress-homeland-security-the-latest.html","snippet":"The Latest on Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly's appearance before a congressional committee (all times local):...","lead_paragraph":"The Latest on Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly's appearance before a congressional committee (all times local):","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"AP","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"The Latest: Kelly Says Trump Order Isn't Muslim Ban","print_headline":"The Latest: Kelly Says Trump Order Isn't Muslim Ban"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2017-02-07T16:04:47+0000","document_type":"article","news_desk":null,"section_name":"U.S.","subsection_name":"Politics","byline":{"person":[],"original":"By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS","organization":"THE ASSOCIATED PRESS"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"5899f02695d0e0392607f0c7","word_count":"783","slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/reuters\/2017\/02\/28\/sports\/soccer\/28reuters-soccer-fifa-valcke.html","snippet":"Former FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke has appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport against his 10-year ban from soccer, the tribunal said on Tuesday....","lead_paragraph":"Former FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke has appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport against his 10-year ban from soccer, the tribunal said on Tuesday.","abstract":null,"print_page":0,"blog":[],"source":"Reuters","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Former FIFA Secretary General Valcke Appeals 10-Year Soccer Ban","print_headline":"Former FIFA Secretary General Valcke Appeals 10-Year Soccer Ban"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2017-02-28T13:30:38+0000","document_type":"article","news_desk":"None","section_name":"Sports","subsection_name":"Soccer","byline":{"person":[],"original":"By REUTERS","organization":"REUTERS"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"58b57b8495d0e024902fca6d","word_count":507,"slideshow_credits":null}]},"status":"OK","copyright":"Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
