The air terminal used to be at the central railroad station (Stazione Termini), but for the World Cup soccer championship finals last June and July it was transferred to a new, vast building, a postmodern annex to the Stazione Ostiense. One reason that many Italian travelers have avoided the new facility is that taxis outside the building are rare. The trip to connect with subways or buses can be cumbersome for arriving air passengers. A series of escalators and people movers on an overpass spanning 14 railroad tracks takes passengers to the square from which municipal buses depart. A long underpass from Ostiense station's Platform No. 1, with moving sidewalks, leads to the Piramide station (one mile south of the Colosseum) of Line B of Rome's rudimentary subway network. From there it is a seven-minute ride (63-cent fare) to the central railroad terminal, where passengers may transfer to Line A, which traverses the center of the city. Travelers with luggage may have a hard time squeezing into crowded subway cars. Daytime bus service between Leonardo da Vinci Intercontinental Airport at Fiumicino (FCO on airline tags) and the central Stazione Termini ended Nov. 20, although the buses still run hourly between 1 and 6 A.M. Fare: about $4.45 (on the basis of 1,120 lire to the dollar). From 6:30 A.M to 12:15 A.M. trains shuttling between Fiumicino Airport and the new City Air Terminal are the only public transportion for arriving or departing plane passengers. The trains run at 20-minute intervals over a newly built rail spur. The $4.45 tickets have to be bought from machines at the airport rail station or at the City Air Terminal. The 16-mile trip takes 25 minutes. A cab ride to the center of Rome from Fiumicino Airport costs at least $45, from the new City Air Terminal (if you find a taxi there), $8 to $10 more in rush-hour traffic. Cruise Ship For Albania The Yugoslav-owned Adriana will be the first cruise ship to take Americans to Albania since the United States and Albania severed diplomatic relations after World War II, according to the ship's New York agent. The Adriana will call at Durazzo, the port for the Albanian capital, Tirana, during a series of eight cruises next summer. Albania lifted its ban on American travel last May, allowing Americans to enter from cruise ships and on organized tours. The 300-passenger, air-conditioned vessel has scheduled 10- and 11-day cruises, starting from Venice. Piraeus, Greece, Istanbul, and the Greek island of Mykonos are among ports of call after stops at Dubrovnik, Yugoslavia, and Durazzo. The trips are scheduled from May to September. Fares range from $1,060 to $1,900 a person, double occupancy. Information: International Cruise Center, 250 Old Country Road, Mineola, N.Y. 11501 (516-747-8880 or 800-221-3254). London's Kew Triples Fee The entrance fee for the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew in London was increased this month from $2 to about $6 ($:1 to $:3). Visitors are handed a letter from Kew's director that says: \"Keeping our gardens and buildings up to the standard expected of the world's best-known botanic garden and funding our vital research on plants, their uses and their conservation is costly.\" The letter adds that the Government's annual grant of about $23 million is no longer adequate and that an additional $40 million a year is needed to finance Kew's worldwide research and conservation projects. Scientists add 45,000 plants a year to the Kew's collection of 6 million specimens. Kew's trustees hope that added attractions will maintain the number of visitors, now about 1.25 million a year. Among the additions are the Princess of Wales Conservatory, which has 10 computer-controlled climate zones under one roof; a multimedia exhibition on various uses of plants, and a new gallery of botanical paintings. Under the the new admission rates, the elderly pay $3, children pay $2 and an annual pass is $24. The increases also apply to Wakehurst Place, Kew's annex garden in Sussex. Kew is open daily from 9:30 A.M. to about an hour before dusk. Phone Check-In In a move to provide aggravation-free hotel check-in for its frequent business travelers, Hyatt Hotels Corporation has started an 800-CHECK-IN line at about 100 hotels in the United States and Canada. The new service allows some two million members of the hotel group's frequent traveler program to confirm reservations and get room numbers ahead of time. Guests must call between 1 and 10 P.M. local hotel time on the day of arrival with a credit card number. Haiti Alert The State Department continues to advise Americans to defer nonessential travel to Haiti in view of the possibility of disturbances arising from the Dec. 16 election there. Although there have been no threats to American citizens, caution should be exercised and crowds avoided, the department adds in an advisory issued this month. Citizens who do travel to Haiti should register on arrival with the consular section of the United States Embassy on the Rue Oswald Durant (509-22-0200) in Port-au-Prince. JERUSALEM ROAD REDISCOVERED After more than a decade of searching, archeologists in Jerusalem have identified the East-West axis built by the Romans about A.D. 135, under Hadrian's rule. The road, the Decomanus, was uncovered during the installation of a new sewer system near Temple Mount, according to Yitzhak Yaacovy, director general of the East Jerusalem Development Corporation. The road and its north-south counterpart, the Cardo Maximus, were in use from Jerusalem's Roman period (roughly the first to fourth centuries A.D.) through the early Arab period, which ended in the 10th century. These routes still define Jerusalem's layout, the Cardo running along Suq Khan el-Zeit from the Damascus Gate south to the Jewish Quarter and the Decomanus along King David Street and the Street of the Chain from the Jaffa Gate to the Western Wall. The Cardo was discovered about 15 years ago, and archeologists have searched since then for the other axis. A half-mile section of the Cardo in the Jewish quarter is now lined with art galleries, boutiques and cafes. Shoppers walk about 10 feet below street level on ancient paving stones, 3 feet by 6 and grooved by the Romans for better footing. The shops there are open daily to 7 P.M. and closed Friday evening and Saturday. The newly discovered portion of the Decomanus will be visible to visitors for a few weeks; it will then be covered over for the sewer project.
