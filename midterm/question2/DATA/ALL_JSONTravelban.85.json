But then Mr. Karls is a seasoned performer, a cool veteran of countless opening nights at many of the world's best houses, including what he calls the ''big four'': La Scala, the Vienna Staatsoper, Covent Garden and the Metropolitan Opera House. He knows he will hit his mark. Give or take three feet. Mr. Karls is a tosser. And while he has never personally graced any of those venerable stages, his bouquets have. Hundreds of them. Mr. Karls, 62, started going to operas and ballets and throwing bouquets to his favorite performers at the age of 9, when other boys were throwing to first. He has attended upward of 2,500 performances and tossed some 750 bouquets in a career spanning more than half a century. Such numbers must place the publicity-shy Mr. Karls among the world's elite tossers. (He declined to be interviewed or photographed for this article; some of the descriptions and information here came from letters he has written to the Metropolitan Opera and Covent Garden.)","abstract":"Tango Tanner article on John Karls, who attends performances worldwide, and tosses expensive bouquets of roses at divas of ballet or opera as signal of his pleasure with performance; some performers are not enamored of his passion, but others are thrilled; photo (M)","print_page":"5","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Have Bouquet, Will Travel","kicker":"DANCE"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"KARLS, JOHN"},{"name":"subject","value":"OPERA"},{"name":"subject","value":"DANCING"}],"pub_date":"2004-07-25T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Arts and Leisure Desk","section_name":"Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Tango","rank":1,"lastname":"TANNER"}],"original":"By TANGO TANNER"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd256ab8eb7c8105d80053e","word_count":1395,"slideshow_credits":null}]},"status":"OK","copyright":"Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
