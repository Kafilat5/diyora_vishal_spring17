As Enron stock climbed and Wall Street was still promoting it, a group of 29 Enron executives and directors began to sell their shares. These insiders received $1.1 billion by selling 17.3 million shares from 1999 through mid-2001, according to court filings based on public records. They continued selling just before Enron's stock started to tumble early last year and the company began its slide into bankruptcy protection.","abstract":"Some Enron Corp shareholders and lawmakers are focusing on $1.1 billion in Enron stock sold by 29 company executives and directors from 1999 through mid-2001 as stock climbed and Wall Street promoted it; chairman Kenneth L Lay was among over dozen Enron executives who sold $30 million or more, selling $101.3 million in 350 trades; many executives, including Lay, retain large holdings; lawyers for insiders and Enron defend trades (M)","print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Before Debacle, Enron Insiders Cashed In $1.1 Billion in Shares","kicker":"ENRON'S COLLAPSE"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"LAY, KENNETH L"},{"name":"organizations","value":"ENRON CORP"},{"name":"subject","value":"INSIDER TRADING"},{"name":"subject","value":"BANKRUPTCIES"}],"pub_date":"2002-01-13T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Business\/Financial Desk","section_name":"Business","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Leslie","rank":1,"lastname":"WAYNE"}],"original":"By LESLIE WAYNE"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd22cb68eb7c8105d7b8d4f","word_count":1391,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2001\/12\/22\/business\/former-head-of-enron-denies-wrongdoing.html","snippet":"As government investigators look for the roots of Enron's demise, the Enron chief executive who quit just months before the company collapsed broke his silence today to deny any responsibility or wrongdoing.

But its name has attained immortality on Wall Street. Enron is now shorthand for the perfect financial storm. Take a high-flying company terribly impressed with its sense of unique mission and ingenuity, and correspondingly contemptuous of its obligations to fully comply with the spirit of accounting rules. Then add fawning investors, Wall Street analysts, journalists and accountants unwilling to allow a company's lack of transparency about its business to get in the way of a dizzying ride, until they realize the destination is the top of a steep cliff.
