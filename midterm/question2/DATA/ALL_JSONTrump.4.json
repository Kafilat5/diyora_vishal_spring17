It was striking, as the House voted 221 to 209 to send the rebels $100 million for their effort to overthrow the Nicaraguan Government, how many of those voting in favor nonetheless expressed deep misgivings about the worthiness of the rebels, also known as contras, and their ability to accomplish their goal. Had this been some abstract debate on Central American policy, the outcome in the Democratic-controlled House might well have been different. But there was nothing abstract about it. In effect, the issue before the House was whether Ronald Reagan should receive a mandate to conduct foreign policy as he sees fit. The lesson of the pro-Reagan vote was that, when the issue is close, the President - perhaps any President, but certainly this one when he puts his prestige on the line - is likely to prevail.","abstract":null,"print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"REAGAN AND THE CONTRAS WIN A ROUND IN THE HOUSE","kicker":"TRUMP CARDS"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"REAGAN, RONALD WILSON"},{"name":"glocations","value":"NICARAGUA"},{"name":"subject","value":"UNITED STATES INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"ARMAMENT, DEFENSE AND MILITARY FORCES"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"CIVIL WAR AND GUERRILLA WARFARE"},{"name":"subject","value":"FOREIGN AID"},{"name":"subject","value":"UNITED STATES ARMAMENT AND DEFENSE"}],"pub_date":"1986-06-29T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Week in Review Desk","section_name":"Washington;
