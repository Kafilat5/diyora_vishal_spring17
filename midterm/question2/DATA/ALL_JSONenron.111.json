Nevertheless, it is gratifying that the subject of excess risk lurking in workers' 401(k) plans is finally front and center with lawmakers. The new focus on a not-new problem stems, of course, from the Enron smash-up, in which many of the company's workers could only watch as their retirement plans -- stuffed with Enron stock -- sank like a stone as the company spiraled into bankruptcy. Most egregiously, workers were prevented from selling their Enron shares for several weeks last fall when the administrator of the plan was being changed; they were trapped and their fortunes plunged. Enron executives, meanwhile, were dumping their shares before the unraveling.","abstract":"Gretchen Morgenson column says employees increase their risk by having major part of their 401(k) retirement plan invested in their own company's stock; cites Enron Corp's example as well as analysis performed by RiskMetrics; graph (M)","print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Tap.
