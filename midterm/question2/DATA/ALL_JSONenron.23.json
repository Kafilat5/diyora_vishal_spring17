The Enron executive who famously warned Kenneth Lay last August that accounting misdeeds threatened to destroy the company was greeted as a hero by the same House members who excoriated Jeffrey Skilling and Andrew Fastow last week. Billy Tauzin, the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, even wished her a happy Valentine's Day. The welcome was largely deserved, though Ms. Watkins's role was not quite as heroic as some have described. In clear, direct testimony that contrasted with last week's obfuscating account by Mr. Skilling, the former Enron C.E.O., Ms. Watkins helped fill in blanks about top management's awareness of the company's freewheeling ways. Asked to describe her reaction to Mr. Skilling's testimony, during which he professed no knowledge of accounting improprieties during his watch, Ms. Watkins aptly quoted advice Mr. Skilling had once shared with employees in a newsletter: ''If it doesn't make any sense, don't believe it.''","abstract":"Editorial on House testimony of Sherron Watkins, Enron executive who warned Kenneth Lay last Aug that accounting misdeeds threatened to destroy company; says her portrayal of Lay as executive duped by clever underlings Jeffrey Skilling and Andrew Fastow is belied by record; says Lay has much to explain, and Watkins's role is not quite as heroic as some have described; says had she taken her concerns to government or media she would have been true whistle-blower","print_page":"20","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Not Quite a Whistle-Blower"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"SKILLING, JEFFREY"},{"name":"persons","value":"WATKINS, SHERRON S"},{"name":"persons","value":"FASTOW, ANDREW"},{"name":"organizations","value":"ENRON CORP"},{"name":"subject","value":"WHISTLE-BLOWERS"},{"name":"subject","value":"EDITORIALS"},{"name":"subject","value":"ETHICS"},{"name":"subject","value":"BANKRUPTCIES"}],"pub_date":"2002-02-15T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Editorial Desk","section_name":"Opinion","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Editorial","_id":"4fd262848eb7c8105d81438f","word_count":532,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2002\/02\/12\/opinion\/l-let-s-make-enron-a-turning-point-582417.html","snippet":"To the Editor:    Re ''Enron Buffed Image to a Shine Even as It Rotted From Within'' (front page, Feb. 10):    As a former oil trader, I was perplexed years ago to see the march upward of Enron's stock, given the difficulty of making money on a re...","lead_paragraph":"To the Editor: Re ''Enron Buffed Image to a Shine Even as It Rotted From Within'' (front page, Feb. 10): As a former oil trader, I was perplexed years ago to see the march upward of Enron's stock, given the difficulty of making money on a regular basis in energy trading, which under the best of circumstances is fraught with risk and volatility.","abstract":"Letter from Eric Brill says Enron is only most recent visible sympton of entire economic system based on greed and private profit","print_page":"22","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Let's Make Enron a Turning Point"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"BRILL, ERIC"},{"name":"organizations","value":"ENRON CORP"},{"name":"subject","value":"ACCOUNTING AND ACCOUNTANTS"},{"name":"subject","value":"ETHICS"},{"name":"subject","value":"BANKRUPTCIES"}],"pub_date":"2002-02-12T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Editorial Desk","section_name":"Opinion","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Letter","_id":"4fd22cb58eb7c8105d7b8c68","word_count":157,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2002\/02\/09\/business\/enron-s-many-strands-politics-enron-preaching-deregulation-worked-statehouse.html","snippet":"When it came to lobbying, the Enron Corporation, and Kenneth L.
