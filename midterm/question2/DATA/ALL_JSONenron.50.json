In papers filed with a bankruptcy court in New York late Friday afternoon, lawyers for Enron, which sought Chapter 11 protection earlier this month, asked Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez to approve an auction of a 51 percent stake in a joint venture. That venture would own Enron's wholesale energy business, which includes Enron Online and which trades commodities ranging from natural gas to steel in addition to complex financial instruments.","abstract":"Enron Corp asks Judge Arthur J Gonzalez to approve quick auction of 51 percent stake in joint venture that would own its energy trading business; drops plan to negotiate deal with one buyer against which other bidders would compete after finding at least 14 potential buyers (M)","print_page":"14","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Enron Seeks Quick Auction of Trading Unit"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"GONZALEZ, ARTHUR J"},{"name":"organizations","value":"ENRON CORP"},{"name":"subject","value":"MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES"},{"name":"subject","value":"BANKRUPTCIES"}],"pub_date":"2001-12-17T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"National Desk","section_name":"U.S.","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1}],"original":"By JONATHAN D.

Nappier has been aggressive when it comes to recovering lost pension fund investments. But she could be facing her biggest challenge yet as she and Attorney General Richard Blumenthal try to recoup millions in losses suffered from the collapse of the Enron Corporation. Enron, the Houston-based energy trader that was once a darling of Wall Street, began a downward spiral in mid-October when it announced staggering third-quarter losses. It has since come under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and Congress.","abstract":"Connecticut Treasurer Denise Nappier and Attorney General Richard Blumenthal have joined forces to try to recoup estimated $15 million in losses suffered by state pension fund as result of collapse of Enron Corp; photo (M)","print_page":"3","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"State Helping Pension Regain Enron Losses"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"BLUMENTHAL, RICHARD"},{"name":"persons","value":"NAPPIER, DENISE L"},{"name":"glocations","value":"CONNECTICUT"},{"name":"organizations","value":"ENRON CORP"},{"name":"subject","value":"PENSIONS AND RETIREMENT PLANS"},{"name":"subject","value":"GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES"}],"pub_date":"2001-12-16T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Connecticut Weekly Desk","section_name":"New York and Region","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Virginia","rank":1,"lastname":"GROARK"}],"original":"By VIRGINIA GROARK"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd2676e8eb7c8105d81d27e","word_count":677,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2001\/12\/02\/business\/private-sector-taking-on-enron-but-not-going-overboard.html","snippet":"It isn't as if he doesn't have enough to do.
