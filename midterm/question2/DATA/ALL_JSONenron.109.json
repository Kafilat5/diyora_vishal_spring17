Investors who spent much of the late 1990's buying stocks on faith, often of companies whose financial statements were indecipherable even to sophisticated analysts, are suddenly wary, and with good reason, of accounting gimmicks. Companies unable to explain the math behind their polished bottom-line numbers are seeing their stocks punished in the wake of Enron's collapse. It is a painful yet healthy process, not unlike the breaking of a fever. Accounting standards have become so subjective in recent years, and auditing firms so obsequious to those they are charged with policing, that there is plenty of room for legal mischief. Companies have far too much leeway in playing with numbers so as to issue Wall Street-pleasing quarterly earnings reports that often bear little relation to reality. What constitutes revenue and when it can be recorded are astonishingly open questions. The same can be said about debt, and how companies must account for mergers. The fact that employee stock options need not be counted as an expense is another oft-cited accounting rule that served to warp reality in the late-90's frenzy.","abstract":"Editorial warns that disclosure that federal regula\u00ef","print_page":"18","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Enronitis"},"keywords":[{"name":"organizations","value":"ENRON CORP"},{"name":"organizations","value":"GLOBAL CROSSING"},{"name":"subject","value":"ACCOUNTING AND ACCOUNTANTS"},{"name":"subject","value":"EDITORIALS"},{"name":"subject","value":"STOCKS AND BONDS"},{"name":"subject","value":"BANKRUPTCIES"}],"pub_date":"2002-02-09T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Editorial Desk","section_name":"Opinion","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Editorial","_id":"4fd21b268eb7c8105d799d36","word_count":436,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2002\/02\/08\/business\/enron-s-many-strands-a-hedge-how-citigroup-hedged-bets-on-enron.html","snippet":"At the time, 18 months ago, the idea seemed unthinkable: Enron, the highflying energy company, in bankruptcy.
