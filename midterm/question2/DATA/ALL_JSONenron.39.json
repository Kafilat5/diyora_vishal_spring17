Much has happened in the ensuing four years, so it is easy to forget the first in a string of corporate scandals that shook our collective trust in business leaders. For an indicted executive, conditions would seem perfect for keeping a low profile ahead of trial. So it was a surprise to see Kenneth Lay, the company's former chairman, claim in a recent speech that prosecutors disregarded the truth. Mr. Lay told a Houston audience that Enron was ''a strong, profitable, growing company even into the fourth quarter of 2001.'' That, of course, was the same quarter in which Enron declared bankruptcy.","abstract":null,"print_page":"26","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Enron Rears Its Head Again","kicker":"Editorial"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"LAY, KENNETH L"},{"name":"organizations","value":"ENRON CORPORATION"},{"name":"subject","value":"FRAUDS AND SWINDLING"}],"pub_date":"2005-12-29T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Editorial Desk","section_name":"Opinion","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Editorial","_id":"4fd25f8b8eb7c8105d80fb69","word_count":455,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2005\/12\/14\/business\/14enron.html","snippet":"In a rare appearance, Kenneth Lay spoke to the Houston Forum and proclaimed his innocence in Enron's collapse....","lead_paragraph":"The well known and the powerful often appear before the Houston Forum, one of the city's elite spots for speakers.
