In just the last few months, two efforts to preserve or restore to the parks ''natural quiet'' -- widely defined as the absence of manmade sound -- has sparked legal and legislative fights. In the first instance, on Dec. 31, 1996, the Interior Department and the Federal Aviation Administration issued regulations affecting sightseeing flights over the Grand Canyon.
