Mr. Belfer controls the equivalent of a 2.86 percent stake in Enron, or 7.04 million common shares, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. While the filing indicated he was considering selling all of the stake, Mr. Belfer said in an interview that he planned to sell only a portion of the shares held by the estate of his father, Arthur B. Belfer, who died in May. His father was the founder of the Belco Petroleum Corporation, which merged in 1983 with what is now Enron.
