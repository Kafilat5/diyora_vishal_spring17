Californians resented the energy trading company's huge profits during their energy crisis, and Democrats in Washington raised questions about Enron's influence within the White House and about the cozy relationship between Enron's chairman, Kenneth Lay, and Vice President Dick Cheney. Nobody seemed better positioned to thrive during the Bush presidency than this Houston-based apostle of deregulation. Wall Street was impressed with Enron's strategy of swooping into formerly regulated markets to broker contracts for natural gas, electricity or unused telecom bandwidth. The company was celebrated as a paragon of American ingenuity, a stodgy gas pipeline company that had reinvented itself as a high-tech clearinghouse in an ever-expanding roster of markets. Enron's push to force utilities into the Internet age with its online trading systems, at a seemingly handsome profit, became an epic tale of the dot-com revolution.","abstract":"Editorial on rise and fall of energy company Enron, which reaped huge profits out of California's energy woes earlier in year and now has seen stock crash amid serious questions about its bookkeeping; more than $1.2 billion in market value has vanished as result of controversial deal with private partnership run by chief financial officer Andrew Fastow","print_page":"24","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"The Rise and Fall of Enron"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"FASTOW, ANDREW"},{"name":"glocations","value":"CALIFORNIA"},{"name":"organizations","value":"ENRON CORP"},{"name":"subject","value":"SHORTAGES"},{"name":"subject","value":"EDITORIALS"},{"name":"subject","value":"PRICES (FARES, FEES AND RATES)"},{"name":"subject","value":"ELECTRIC LIGHT AND POWER"}],"pub_date":"2001-11-02T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Editorial Desk","section_name":"Opinion","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Editorial","_id":"4fd229888eb7c8105d7b31aa","word_count":560,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2001\/10\/27\/business\/enron-taps-all-its-credit-lines-to-buy-back-3.3-billion-of-debt.html","snippet":"The Enron Corporation, trying to reassure investors that it has ample liquidity, began to repurchase all its outstanding commercial paper yesterday, using $3.3 billion it borrowed from banks by depleting its lines of credit.
