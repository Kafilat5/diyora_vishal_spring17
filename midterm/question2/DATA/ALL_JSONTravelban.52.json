Having conducted paleoanthropological research for periods of up to three months over the last six years and having returned from 10 days in Libya the day your news story appeared (Dec. 11), I can sustain the arguments of others in Libya that the possibility of personal danger for Americans in that country is remote. Mr. Reagan's recent actions and his closing of the Libyan Embassy in Washington belie the fact that close scientific and academic connections exist between the U.S. and Libya. The largest single group of Libyan students is in the U.S., a number of Americans hold or have held positions in Libyan universities and there are a number of Libyan-American research projects.","abstract":null,"print_page":"18","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"NEEDLESS U.S. BAN ON TRAVEL TO LIBYA"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"REAGAN, RONALD WILSON"},{"name":"glocations","value":"LIBYA"},{"name":"subject","value":"UNITED STATE INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"}],"pub_date":"1981-12-23T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Editorial Desk","section_name":"Opinion","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Letter","_id":"4fd120448eb7c8105d5e0e6c","word_count":353,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/abstract.html?res=9E05E5DC1139F934A25751C1A966948260","snippet":"Occupied West Bank - Bashir Barghouti, editor of the Communist weekly Al Talia, Arabic for for The Vanguard, smiled ruefully at a banner fluttering over  this town's main street: ''El Bireh, City on the Move.''
