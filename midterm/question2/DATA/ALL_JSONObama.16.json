the major threats to our national security, the first to come to mind are nuclear proliferation, rogue states and global terrorism. But another kind of threat lurks beyond our shores, one from nature, not humans -- an avian flu pandemic. An outbreak could cause millions of deaths, destabilize Southeast Asia (its likely place of origin), and threaten the security of governments around the world. Earlier this year, Dr. Julie L. Gerberding, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, called the possibility of avian flu spreading from Southeast Asia ''a very ominous situation for the globe.'' A killer flu could spread around the world in days, crippling economies in Southeast Asia and elsewhere. From a public health standpoint, Dr. Gerberding said, an avian flu outbreak is ''the most important threat that we are facing right now.''","abstract":"Op-Ed article by Sens Barack Obama and Richard Lugar says outbreak of avian influenza could cause millions of deaths, destabilize its likely place of origin, Southeast Asia, and threaten security of governments around world;
