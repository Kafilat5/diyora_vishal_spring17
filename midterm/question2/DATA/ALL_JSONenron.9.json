Sober-minded commentators appear, describing the huge scale of Enron's collapse in terse, broadcast-ready sound bites, but the jarring, doom-laden voice, like a skid row Cassandra, keeps returning: ''He's hiding something from the rest of us,'' it declares over ominous clanks, thumps and whirs. ''We have a right to know.'' It's not the way you might expect a documentary about one of the largest corporate bankruptcies in American history to begin, but it's characteristic of ''Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room,'' a film by Alex Gibney that is to open in New York and Houston on Friday. Like ''Fahrenheit 9\/11'' and ''Super Size Me,'' this film is a blend of documentary reportage and pop-culture provocation. The voice of prophetic warning at the beginning belongs to Tom Waits; it's from ''What's He Building?,'' a track on Mr. Waits's 1999 album, ''Mule Variations.'' Mr. Waits gets the film's last word as well. As the credits run and the viewer's mind reels from the collapse of Enron's $65 billion empire, Mr. Waits's ''God's Away on Business'' provides an epitaph for the company's lawless, Darwinian worldview.","abstract":"Article discusses the unusual sound track that accompanies the film Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room, directed by Alex Gibney; features songs by Tom Wait, Judy Garland, Marilyn Manson and many others as well as an original score by Matt Hauser; photos (M)","print_page":"20","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2005\/04\/17\/arts\/17decu75.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2005\/04\/17\/arts\/17decu75.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75}],"headline":{"main":"The Unlikely Greek Chorus Singing the Enron Blues","kicker":"FILM"},"keywords":[{"name":"creative_works","value":"ENRON: THE SMARTEST GUYS IN THE ROOM (MOVIE)"},{"name":"persons","value":"WAITS, TOM"},{"name":"persons","value":"GIBNEY, ALEX"},{"name":"persons","value":"HAUSER, MATT"},{"name":"organizations","value":"ENRON CORPORATION"},{"name":"subject","value":"MUSIC"},{"name":"subject","value":"MOTION PICTURES"},{"name":"subject","value":"DOCUMENTARY FILMS AND PROGRAMS"}],"pub_date":"2005-04-17T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Arts and Leisure Desk","section_name":"Movies; Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Anthony","lastname":"DeCURTIS"}],"original":"By ANTHONY DeCURTIS"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd24abd8eb7c8105d7e8d8e","word_count":958,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2002\/07\/28\/business\/business-fallout-from-a-free-for-all.html","snippet":"ROSS M.

Following are excerpts from a recent conversation. WILLIAM J. HOLSTEIN Q. Was it conceivable that Kenneth L. Lay didn't know what was going on inside his own company? A. It's certainly possible. He had a very laissez-faire attitude toward the running of his own company, which is a good part of what went wrong at Enron. Rather than having central guidance, things were set up as a free-for-all. You had Jeff Skilling [then president of Enron] pursuing an ''asset lite'' strategy at the same time that Rebecca Mark [then chief executive of Enron Development] was flying around the world buying very expensive assets.","abstract":"Interview with Ross M Miller, co-author of book What Went Wrong With Enron, who thinks that bankrupt former energy giant generally stumbled into its problems; photo (M)","print_page":"6","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Business; Fallout From a Free-for-All"},"keywords":[{"name":"creative_works","value":"WHAT WENT WRONG WITH ENRON (BOOK)"},{"name":"persons","value":"MILLER, ROSS M"},{"name":"organizations","value":"ENRON CORP"},{"name":"subject","value":"BOOKS AND LITERATURE"},{"name":"subject","value":"ETHICS"},{"name":"subject","value":"BANKRUPTCIES"}],"pub_date":"2002-07-28T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Money and Business\/Financial Desk","section_name":"Business; Books","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"William","middlename":"J.","lastname":"HOLSTEIN","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By WILLIAM J.
