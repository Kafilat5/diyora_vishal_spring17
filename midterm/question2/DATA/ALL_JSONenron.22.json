Lay, did not commit the crimes he admitted to under a plea deal with prosecutors. The witness, Mark E. Koenig, Enron's former head of investor relations, is the first of several former Enron employees who are expected to testify against Mr. Skilling and Mr. Lay after striking deals with the government to avoid trials.","abstract":null,"print_page":"5","blog":[],"source":"Reuters","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Enron Witness's Plea Bargain Is Questioned by the Defense"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"SKILLING, JEFFREY K"},{"name":"persons","value":"LAY, KENNETH L"},{"name":"organizations","value":"ENRON CORPORATION"}],"pub_date":"2006-02-10T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Business\/Financial Desk","section_name":"Business","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd267118eb7c8105d81c289","word_count":354,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2006\/02\/03\/business\/03settle.html","snippet":"Enron said Thursday that Lehman Holdings had agreed to pay the company $69.9 million in cash to settle equity transactions proceedings....","lead_paragraph":"Enron said yesterday that Lehman Holdings had agreed to pay the company $69.9 million in cash to settle equity transactions proceedings.

Investors who have seen executives drive their companies off a cliff don't necessarily gain succor from such parades, or from the dry sentences and fines that may be doled out by a jury. They crave that deeper, more satisfying sense of justice that comes from seeing somebody get what they think he truly deserves. The difference between court justice and what I'd like to call ''sublime justice'' is not a difficult concept. But it's a bit nuanced, so here's an example. It seems that Kenneth L. Lay, the former Enron chairman who faces trial next January on fraud charges, has paid Google, the online search service, to place ads next to or above searches about Enron and related topics and direct people to a site that gives his side of the story.
