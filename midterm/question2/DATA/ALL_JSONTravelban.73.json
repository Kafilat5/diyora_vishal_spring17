No similar action has been taken, however, for two other Americans who applied for visas to attend the fair - Robert Bernstein, president of Random House, and Jeri Laber, an aide with the Association of American Publishers. Mr. Bernstein is chairman of the Helsinki Watch Committee, a human rights group that monitors compliance with the 1975 Helsinki accords, and Miss Laber is executive director of the group. Although the Association of American Publishers made appeals to Soviet officials in Washington and Moscow on behalf of the others denied permission to attend the fair, visas are not expected to be granted for Mr. Bernstein and Miss Laber because of their affiliation with Helsinki Watch.","abstract":null,"print_page":"21","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"SOVIET LIFTS BAN ON 1 U.S. DELEGATE"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"LEVINSON, BERNARD"},{"name":"glocations","value":"UNION OF SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLICS"},{"name":"organizations","value":"MOSCOW INTERNATIONAL BOOK FAIR"},{"name":"organizations","value":"JEWISH BOOK PUBLISHERS, ASSN OF"},{"name":"organizations","value":"BOOK PUBLISHERS OF NEW YORK, ASSN OF JEWISH"},{"name":"subject","value":"TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"BOOKS AND LITERATURE"},{"name":"subject","value":"BOOK FAIRS"},{"name":"subject","value":"VISAS"}],"pub_date":"1985-09-05T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Cultural Desk","section_name":"Travel; Arts; Books","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Herbert","rank":1,"lastname":"MITGANG"}],"original":"By HERBERT MITGANG"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd15d848eb7c8105d645208","word_count":410,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/reuters\/2016\/06\/13\/world\/asia\/13reuters-taiwan-china-hongkong.html","snippet":"Taiwan's opposition Nationalist Party slammed the self-ruled island's new government as \"suppressive\" for barring former president Ma Ying-jeou from travelling to Chinese-controlled Hong Kong on the grounds of national security....","lead_paragraph":"Taiwan's opposition Nationalist Party slammed the self-ruled island's new government as \"suppressive\" for barring former president Ma Ying-jeou from travelling to Chinese-controlled Hong Kong on the grounds of national security.
