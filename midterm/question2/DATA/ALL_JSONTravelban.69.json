The High Court of Justice upheld the restrictions that limit Mr. Vanunu's movements inside Israel and prevent him from leaving the country for a year. Mr. Vanunu is also barred from speaking to foreigners, including the foreign media. The court said the restrictions were necessary because Mr. Vanunu could disclose more secrets. ''I don't like Israel,'' Mr. Vanunu told journalists after the court decision. ''I don't want to live in Israel.'' Mr. Vanunu, a former nuclear technician, was imprisoned after he detailed his work at Israel's secretive nuclear reactor in a 1986 interview with the British newspaper The Sunday Times.
