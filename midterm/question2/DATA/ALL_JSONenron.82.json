Rowland asked nine of the authority's board members yesterday to resign. The Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority lost about $213 million in a murky deal with Enron last year and then, in February, raised municipal dumping fees to make up the loss, outraging taxpayers. Last week, Mr. Rowland, up for re-election in November, dismissed Peter Ellef, his co-chief of staff, who was also the most prominent of the governor's 12 appointees to the trash board. Yesterday, the governor sent out letters demanding that his nine remaining appointees resign by June 30.
