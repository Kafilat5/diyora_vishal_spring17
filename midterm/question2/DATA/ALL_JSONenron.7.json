And now ''Enron: The Musical.'' Opening on Friday on a stage way, way off Broadway -- at Lambert Hall in Houston -- the revue is a send-up of the rise and fall of the infamous energy company. In two acts, six local actors each play up to 10 roles, including those of the former chief executives Kenneth L. Lay and Jeffrey K. Skilling, and the former finance chief Andrew S. Fastow. The songs are show-tune parodies -- ''Thank Heaven for Off The Books Deals,'' for example, instead of ''Thank Heaven for Little Girls.'' The writer-director-producer is Mark Fraser, whose day job is selling janitorial supplies.","abstract":"Mark Fraser directs and pr\u00ff","print_page":"2","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"First Time as Tragedy, Second as a Musical","kicker":"OPENERS: SUITS"},"keywords":[{"name":"creative_works","value":"ENRON: THE MUSICAL (PLAY)"},{"name":"persons","value":"FRASER, MARK"},{"name":"organizations","value":"ENRON CORP"},{"name":"subject","value":"FRAUDS AND SWINDLING"},{"name":"subject","value":"ETHICS"},{"name":"subject","value":"THEATER"}],"pub_date":"2006-11-26T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Money and Business\/Financial Desk","section_name":"Business","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Kate","lastname":"MURPHY"}],"original":"By KATE MURPHY"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd279658eb7c8105d83c9f9","word_count":189,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/dealbook.nytimes.com\/2010\/09\/29\/d-o-j-seeks-broader-fraud-law-to-cover-self-dealing\/","snippet":"The Justice Department asked Congress on Tuesday for a law that would restore powers prosecutors have used against public and private sector officials who intentionally hide conflicts of interest for personal gain....","lead_paragraph":"The Justice Department asked Congress on Tuesday for a law that would restore powers prosecutors have used against public and private sector officials who intentionally hide conflicts of interest for personal gain, The New York Times's Ashley Southall reported.","abstract":"The Justice Department asked Congress on Tuesday for a law that would restore powers prosecutors have used against public and private sector officials who intentionally hide conflicts of interest for personal gain.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"D.O.J.
