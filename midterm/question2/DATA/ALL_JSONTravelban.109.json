The sound of upcountry music, the rare scent of fresh earth or flowers, or the sight of hill tribe people in traditional dress squatting in front of a video shop are reminders that beyond this polluted, traffic-clogged city, there is another Thailand. It can be found in almost any direction: north to the cool mountains, south along an endless seacoast, west into peaceful river valleys, northeast into the majestic world of the Mekong. Although the number of tourists traveling beyond Bangkok from Japan, Hong Kong and Europe is increasing, this is a country that is mostly still off the tourist track, while easily manageable for independent travelers. Visitors willing to put up with some fairly basic hotels and eating places enjoy in return remarkably varied scenery and the atmosphere of a nation reflecting Sinetic, Indic and Malay cultures, yet always very Thai. That means Thai (or Chinese-Thai) food in every town, and the ubiquitous enthusiasm with which Thais try to please visitors.","abstract":null,"print_page":"13","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"ON RURAL ROUTES THROUGH THAILAND"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"THAILAND"},{"name":"subject","value":"TRAVEL AND VACATIONS"}],"pub_date":"1986-12-21T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Travel Desk","section_name":"Travel","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Barbara","rank":1,"lastname":"CROSSETTE"}],"original":"By BARBARA CROSSETTE; Barbara Crossette is the Bangkok bureau chief of The New York Times"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd164e18eb7c8105d6514d2","word_count":2592,"slideshow_credits":null}]},"status":"OK","copyright":"Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
