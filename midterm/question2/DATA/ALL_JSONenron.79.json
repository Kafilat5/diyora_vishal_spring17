That Enron blazed a path to the summit of the energy world was not in dispute. In the 1990's, it was a Wall Street darling, the pride of an energy city and the creator of an industry that bought and sold natural gas, electricity and anything else its ambitious employees could dream up. But since its bankruptcy, Enron has come to symbolize the corporate malfeasance that infected so many American corporations in the 1990's.","abstract":null,"print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"In Opening Arguments, an Enron Undone by Lies, or Panic"},"keywords":[{"name":"organizations","value":"ENRON CORPORATION"},{"name":"subject","value":"EXECUTIVES AND MANAGEMENT"},{"name":"subject","value":"JURY SYSTEM"}],"pub_date":"2006-02-01T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Business\/Financial Desk","section_name":"Business","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Alexei","lastname":"BARRIONUEVO"}],"original":"By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd269368eb7c8105d81fd14","word_count":1353,"slideshow_credits":null}]},"status":"OK","copyright":"Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
