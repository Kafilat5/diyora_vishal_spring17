While more than a dozen energy traders have hundreds of millions of dollars of outstanding claims against Enron, Enron's ruin is likely to mean new profits for rivals that could make Enron's i.o.u.'s look like pocket change, analysts and some executives said. ''We are one of the companies that will pick up the slack if Enron ceases to exist,'' said Eric van der Walde, executive vice president for trading and marketing at American Electric Power of Columbus, Ohio.

Options, he said, are the most egregious way for companies to pump up their profits artificially. They also netted him a tidy $62.5 million in 2000 and helped Enron pay no income taxes in four of the last five years. Stock options, in theory, aren't a bad idea. By giving employees the chance to buy a company's stock in the future at today's price, corporations can provide an extra incentive for hard work and can augment compensation. The New York Times Company awards options to its top executives. But like other rational business practices that got out of hand during the boom years of the late 1990's, options have been abused by some companies and are in need of reform.","abstract":"Editorial comments on misuse of stock options, contending that like other rational business practices that got out of hand during boom years of late 1990's, options have been abused by some companies and are in need of reform; holds Jeffrey Skilling, Enron's former chief executive, in his Congressional testimony last month, offered primer on misuses of stock options; holds good place to start would be for Congress to end conflict between how tax laws and accounting rules treat options","print_page":"8","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Stock Option Excesses"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"SKILLING, JEFFREY"},{"name":"organizations","value":"ENRON CORP"},{"name":"subject","value":"EXECUTIVES AND MANAGEMENT"},{"name":"subject","value":"EDITORIALS"},{"name":"subject","value":"STOCK OPTIONS AND PURCHASE PLANS"},{"name":"subject","value":"STOCKS AND BONDS"}],"pub_date":"2002-03-31T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Editorial Desk","section_name":"Opinion","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Editorial","_id":"4fd2826c8eb7c8105d84f85d","word_count":"587","slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2006\/06\/09\/business\/businessspecial3\/09enron.html","snippet":"A judge ordered Daniel H.
