Top Enron executives were allowed to sell off hundreds of millions of dollars of the doomed company's stock before it turned worthless -- at which point employees and most shareholders took devastating losses. Federal and state investigators are now focusing on possible criminal misconduct, yet the more interesting question is whether Enron's collapse will undermine public trust in business. In the last century, Americans' trust in major financial and Wall Street institutions has gyrated considerably. These shifts have been accompanied by larger changes in American politics: public trust in American business tends to determine how much Americans look to the federal government to regulate corporate behavior. It may also influence young people's desire to work in the business world, as opposed to pursuing other livelihoods like education, government service or medicine.","abstract":"Op-Ed article by David Callahan says most interesting question posed by collapse of Enron Corp is whether it will undermine public trust in American business, because such trust tends to determine how much Americans look to federal government to regulate corporate behavior; notes that Enron revelations are coming in wake of erosion in trust of business generally and of Wall Street in particular; calls for clear policy agenda in wake of Enron's collapse: more federal oversight of corporate governance, private pensions and accounting procedures; says links between Bush administration and Enron also highlight need for campaign finance reform to reduce access of big corporate donors to highest government officials; drawing (M)","print_page":"21","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Private Sector, Public Doubts"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"BUSH, GEORGE W"},{"name":"organizations","value":"ENRON CORP"},{"name":"subject","value":"ACCOUNTING AND ACCOUNTANTS"},{"name":"subject","value":"UNITED STATES ECONOMY"},{"name":"subject","value":"FINANCES"},{"name":"subject","value":"ETHICS"},{"name":"subject","value":"PENSIONS AND RETIREMENT PLANS"},{"name":"subject","value":"ELECTIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"REGULATION AND DEREGULATION OF INDUSTRY"},{"name":"subject","value":"BANKRUPTCIES"}],"pub_date":"2002-01-15T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Editorial Desk","section_name":"Opinion","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"David","rank":1,"lastname":"Callahan"}],"original":"By David Callahan"},"type_of_material":"Op-Ed","_id":"4fd2335d8eb7c8105d7c3e28","word_count":652,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2001\/12\/23\/weekinreview\/imagine-this-is-a-job-for-ken-starr.html","snippet":"Congress, the media and a special prosecutor spent years and millions of dollars trying to unearth information about President Bill Clinton's links to a small real estate investment called Whitewater.

But the political ties of Enron, the energy giant that collapsed last month in the largest bankruptcy in history, has so far prompted only a smattering of scrutiny. Houston-based Enron and its longtime boss, Kenneth W. Lay, were top supporters of President Bush. The company and it employees gave Mr. Bush nearly $2 million between 1993, when Mr. Bush was the governor of Texas, and the presidential election. They were among the top supporters of members of Congress as well, especially Republicans.","abstract":"Political ties of Enron, energy giant that collapsed in largest bankruptcy in history, has so far prompted only smattering of scrutiny in wake of Sept 11 terrorist attacks (S)","print_page":"4","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Imagine; This is a Job for Ken Starr"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"NEW YORK CITY"},{"name":"glocations","value":"WASHINGTON (DC)"},{"name":"organizations","value":"ENRON CORP"},{"name":"subject","value":"WORLD TRADE CENTER (NYC)"},{"name":"subject","value":"AIRLINES AND AIRPLANES"},{"name":"subject","value":"ETHICS"},{"name":"subject","value":"HIJACKING"},{"name":"subject","value":"TERRORISM"},{"name":"subject","value":"BANKRUPTCIES"}],"pub_date":"2001-12-23T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Week in Review Desk","section_name":"Week in Review","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Joseph","rank":1,"lastname":"KAHN"}],"original":"By JOSEPH KAHN"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd218e18eb7c8105d795ffe","word_count":253,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2001\/12\/12\/business\/management-victims-and-champions-of-a-darwinian-enron.html","snippet":"After an accounting scandal, a bankruptcy filing and mass layoffs, Enron has gone from model of management vision to case study for management obfuscation.

With overseas investment pouring in, the economy has boomed. But now many of India's gains are imperiled by a recrudescence of nationalist sentiment that threatens to drive foreign companies away. Fear of economic colonization is as old as India itself, but India's leaders must transcend these anxieties if future progress is to be secured. The focus of the latest anti-foreign hysteria is a proposed $2.8 billion power plant to be constructed outside Bombay by a consortium of American companies led by the Enron Corporation of Houston, a large natural gas supplier. The plant would be the biggest foreign investment in India since the economy started opening up five years ago. It is also desperately needed.","abstract":null,"print_page":"18","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Looking Backward in India"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"INDIA"},{"name":"organizations","value":"ENRON CORP"},{"name":"subject","value":"FOREIGN INVESTMENTS"},{"name":"subject","value":"MULTINATIONAL COMPANIES"},{"name":"subject","value":"EDITORIALS"},{"name":"subject","value":"ELECTRIC LIGHT AND POWER"},{"name":"subject","value":"ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND TRENDS"}],"pub_date":"1995-07-26T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Editorial Desk","section_name":"Opinion","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Editorial","_id":"4fd1ce258eb7c8105d7059e3","word_count":412,"slideshow_credits":null}]},"status":"OK","copyright":"Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
