Even though this capital of East Tyrol is 2,200 feet above sea level, the sun shines down on it most of the year, separating it from the more famous, crowded and cloudy resorts on the north side of the Alps. I was in the arcaded sidewalk cafe of the Hotel Garni Eck, drinking a melange, an Austrian version of cafe con leche, and watching the passers-by in this city of 15,000 residents crisscross the city's main square, the Hauptplatz. Many of the older strollers wore the traditional green, feathered Tyrolean hat. Behind them were the white-trimmed windows, powder gray walls and onion domes of the town hall, housed in Liebburg Castle. The castle was once the home of the Baron of Wolkenstein-Rodenegg, who bought the Lordship of Lienz from Emperor Maximilian in the 16th century. To the south and west, the romantic Dolomites, a line of unforgettably jagged peaks, towered over the city. An almost vertical wall of stone more than 8,000 feet high, these rocky pinnacles achieve a haunting rose at sunset.","abstract":"Bill O'Sullivan article on Lienz, sunny Austrian mountain town that was an important stop on overland European trade routes during the middle ages; photos; map (M)","print_page":"12","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Austria, Circa 1400"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"LIENZ (AUSTRIA)"},{"name":"glocations","value":"AUSTRIA"},{"name":"subject","value":"TRAVEL AND VACATIONS"}],"pub_date":"1997-08-03T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Travel Desk","section_name":"Travel","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Bill","rank":1,"lastname":"O'SULLIVAN"}],"original":"By BILL O'SULLIVAN"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd1deea8eb7c8105d723caa","word_count":2358,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/abstract.html?res=9F04E4D8133DEE3BBC4E52DFBF66838A649EDE","snippet":"THE resort operators of the nation who sit down to add  up the scars and the net profits of the summer that ends this week will find much of each to enter in their ledgers.

But after hearing friends rave about their trip to the tiny Buddhist kingdom tucked in the Himalayas, Ms. George, president of a foundation that promotes holistic medicine, was hooked. This fall, she and her husband made the long journey from their home in Minneapolis to Bhutan's sole airport, then spent seven days on a guided tour, trekking into virgin forests, tiptoeing into temples and passing through villages where men and women still go about in traditional dress. ''Bhutan has bubbled up in the collective consciousness,'' said Ms. George. ''I just felt like I had to go.'' Move over, Cambodia. Bhutan is the new must-see destination in southern Asia. With Tibet in the grip of Communist China and Nepal deemed unsafe by the United States State Department, this peaceful nation half the size of Indiana is emerging as a big draw, attracting those in search of a spiritual journey, a hiking adventure -- or just a chance to experience a place before the rest of the world gets there. The number of visitors to Bhutan, as small as a few thousand not long ago, increased to 9,000 last year, a third of them Americans. Travel agents report an upswing in interest in Bhutan, and tour operators like Abercrombie & Kent are adding both trekking and cultural trips to their rosters. ''Among those who have been everywhere, seen everything,'' said Rok Klancnik of the World Tourism Organization, a United Nations agency based in Madrid, ''interest in Bhutan is growing.''","abstract":"Janet Margolies travel article on why Bhutan, with one main road and only five months of prime travel weather, has become new must-see destination in southern Asia; photos; map (L)","print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2005\/01\/09\/travel\/09bhutan.75.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2005\/01\/09\/travel\/09bhutan.75.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75}],"headline":{"main":"Why Is Everyone Going to Bhutan?"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"BHUTAN"},{"name":"subject","value":"TRAVEL AND VACATIONS"}],"pub_date":"2005-01-09T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Travel Desk","section_name":"Travel","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Jane","lastname":"MARGOLIES"}],"original":"By JANE MARGOLIES"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd283978eb7c8105d8516e9","word_count":1601,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2011\/04\/03\/travel\/03next-gili.html","snippet":"Luxury villas are springing up on Gili Trawangan, an island once more famous for its magic mushrooms....","lead_paragraph":"Luxury villas are springing up on Gili Trawangan, an island once more famous for its magic mushrooms.","abstract":null,"print_page":"9","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"width":190,"url":"images\/2011\/04\/03\/travel\/03next-map\/03next-map-thumbWide.jpg","height":126,"subtype":"wide","legacy":{"wide":"images\/2011\/04\/03\/travel\/03next-map\/03next-map-thumbWide.jpg","wideheight":"126","widewidth":"190"},"type":"image"},{"width":600,"url":"images\/2011\/04\/03\/travel\/03next-span\/03next-span-articleLarge.jpg","height":331,"subtype":"xlarge","legacy":{"xlargewidth":"600","xlarge":"images\/2011\/04\/03\/travel\/03next-span\/03next-span-articleLarge.jpg","xlargeheight":"331"},"type":"image"},{"width":75,"url":"images\/2011\/04\/03\/travel\/03next-span\/03next-span-thumbStandard.jpg","height":75,"subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"thumbnailheight":"75","thumbnail":"images\/2011\/04\/03\/travel\/03next-span\/03next-span-thumbStandard.jpg","thumbnailwidth":"75"},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"seo":"On an Island East of Bali, a Backpacker's Hideaway Goes Upscale","main":"On an Island East of Bali, a Backpacker\u2019s Hideaway Goes Upscale","content_kicker":"Next Stop","print_headline":"A Remote \u2018Party\u2019 Island Polishes Its Image"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","is_major":"N","name":"subject","value":"Travel and Vacations"},{"rank":"2","is_major":"N","name":"glocations","value":"Indonesia"}],"pub_date":"2011-04-03T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Travel","section_name":"Travel","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"contributor":"","person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Dan","rank":1,"lastname":"LEVIN"}],"original":"By DAN LEVIN"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"52b8b11538f0d86bcb2a6ca4","word_count":"1451","slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1982\/04\/18\/travel\/ancient-and-modern-judaic-landmarks.html","snippet":"MOSHE BRILLIANT is on the staff of The Times bureau in Jerusalem.

Your guide may tell you that the Wall, or at least its foundations, are relics of King Solomon's Temple, destroyed by the Babylonians in 587 B.C. In fact, the Wall was erected by Herod the Great in the closing years of the first century B.C. This in no way detracts from its sanctity, however. For 2,000 years, the Wall has been the focal point of Jewish prayer. It became known as the Wailing Wall because of the tears shed there (Israelis refer to it officially as the Western Wall).
