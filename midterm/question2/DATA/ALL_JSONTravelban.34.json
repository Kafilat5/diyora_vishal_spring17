The decision, by the islands' department of tourism, was conveyed to the cruise lines in a letter last month from L. Angela Martins, the director of tourism. While Grand Cayman, the islands' capital, is a familiar stop on cruises to the western Caribbean and through the Panama Canal, only a few ships call there on Sunday. But Royal Caribbean's Splendour of the Seas docks there on its 10- and 11-day Caribbean itineraries, and has six Sunday visits scheduled for this year, through April 18. Cayman Islands officials have waived the ban for those six visits, and in return Royal Caribbean has agreed to move its scheduled Good Friday call on April 2 to April 1, stopping on Good Friday at Ocho Rios, Jamaica. At press time Royal Caribbean and Celebrity officials were still discussing whether Celebrity's Mercury would stop at the Cayman Islands on Good Friday, as scheduled, or also switch days or skip that port. Princess and Costa cruise lines are also talking with Cayman Islands officials, while Norwegian Cruise Line, with only one Sunday call at Grand Cayman scheduled for this year, says it will abide by the ban.","abstract":"Cruise ships will no longer be permitted to dock at Cayman Islands on Sundays, Christmas or Good Friday, apparently because of complaints from church officials; map (S)","print_page":"3","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Never on Sunday, Says Cayman Islands","kicker":"TRAVEL ADVISORY"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"CAYMAN ISLANDS"},{"name":"subject","value":"SHIPS AND SHIPPING"},{"name":"subject","value":"SABBATH OBSERVANCE"},{"name":"subject","value":"CHRISTIANS AND CHRISTIANITY"},{"name":"subject","value":"TRAVEL AND VACATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"CRUISES"},{"name":"subject","value":"GOOD FRIDAY"},{"name":"subject","value":"CHRISTMAS"}],"pub_date":"1999-01-10T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Travel Desk","section_name":null,"subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd20dfb8eb7c8105d77ed30","word_count":248,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1994\/05\/08\/travel\/travel-advisory-roulette-wheel-stilled-on-ships-off-alaska.html","snippet":"Gambling will be prohibited this year for the first time on all cruise ships plying the waters off Alaska's rugged coastline.

Authorities at Dallas-Fort Worth Airport recently declared the entire passenger terminal off-limits to smokers. And starting July 26, it will be unlawful to smoke in restaurants in Los Angeles -- at least as long as patrons don't walk across the street into Beverly Hills, West Hollywood or Santa Monica. But even those refuges may not last long. In one of his last acts as Mayor, Tom Bradley signed a bill putting all 7,000 or so restaurants in Los Angeles, the nation's second largest city, off-limits to smoking. There are some exceptions: bars, nightclubs, dance halls, rented banquet rooms and outdoor gardens and sidewalk eating areas of restaurants. Violators face a $50 citation on the first offense, $100 on the second within a year and $250 each after that. Restaurateurs who fail to enforce the ban face greater risks: six months in jail and fines of up to $1,000 per violation.","abstract":null,"print_page":"3","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"More Places Are Off-Limits For Smokers","kicker":"TRAVEL ADVISORY"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"LOS ANGELES (CALIF)"},{"name":"subject","value":"AIRPORTS"},{"name":"subject","value":"SMOKING"},{"name":"subject","value":"LAW AND LEGISLATION"},{"name":"subject","value":"DALLAS-FORT WORTH INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT"},{"name":"subject","value":"NYTRAVEL"}],"pub_date":"1993-07-18T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Travel Desk","section_name":null,"subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Robert","rank":1,"lastname":"Reinhold"}],"original":"By Robert Reinhold"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd1e0548eb7c8105d727093","word_count":297,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1992\/01\/26\/travel\/travel-advisory-bwia-takes-birds-out-of-air.html","snippet":"B.W.I.A.

The Humane Society of the United States reports that of more than 7 million birds imported into the country during the past decade 1.2 million died in transit or in quarantine. (The Department of Agriculture quarantines birds for 30 days then examines them and returns them to the country of origin if they are not healthy.
