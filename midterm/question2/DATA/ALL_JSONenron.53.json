But it also creates challenges for prosecutors that did not exist before. Under the agreement announced last week, the trader, Timothy N. Belden, pleaded guilty to conspiring with others to manipulate the California energy market during the state's energy crises that began in 2000, and he agreed to cooperate in the investigation of Enron. In his statements to the court, Mr. Belden acknowledged submitting false commitments for energy delivery for the purpose of driving up prices.","abstract":"Recent plea agreement with former senior Enron trader Timothy N Belden presents new opportunities for law enforcement officials investigating range of possible crimes at company; he admits to conspiring with others to manipulate California energy market during its 2000 crisis and acting to force up prices; higher Enron management may be implicated; certain former admissions Belden made might leave his testimony open to attack by defense counsel (M)","print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"A Powerful, Flawed Witness Against Enron"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"BELDEN, TIMOTHY N"},{"name":"glocations","value":"CALIFORNIA"},{"name":"organizations","value":"ENRON CORP"},{"name":"subject","value":"FRAUDS AND SWINDLING"},{"name":"subject","value":"PLEA BARGAINING"},{"name":"subject","value":"BLACKOUTS AND BROWNOUTS (ELECTRICAL)"},{"name":"subject","value":"SHORTAGES"},{"name":"subject","value":"ETHICS"},{"name":"subject","value":"ELECTRIC LIGHT AND POWER"}],"pub_date":"2002-10-21T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Business\/Financial Desk","section_name":"Business","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Kurt","rank":1,"lastname":"EICHENWALD"}],"original":"By KURT EICHENWALD"},"type_of_material":"An Analysis; News Analysis","_id":"4fd222e38eb7c8105d7a7ff2","word_count":1114,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2002\/06\/12\/business\/enron-agrees-to-increase-severance-by-30-million.html","snippet":"The Enron Corporation has agreed to pay nearly $30 million in additional severance to about 4,200 former employees who were laid off after the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last December.

It was the fear I noticed, and I saw it first when I sat down with Elyse Lanier. Lanier is the wife of the former mayor and the closest thing the fourth-largest city in the country has to a mother. In her enormous diamonds and green leather pants, she ate a hamburger and fries and spoke of ''the setbacks we've had'' -- Tropical Storm Allison and the floods it caused, the Andrea Yates murders and trial. What made it worse was that all these outsiders had come in to gawk and had not helped at all. And it was then, while the reporters were standing around, that the most embarrassing thing happened.","abstract":"Randall Patteson profile of Houston in wake of series of setbacks: Tripical Storm Allison and flooding it caused, Andrea Yates murders and trial and, most embarrassingly, collapse of Enron Corp; photos (L)","print_page":"82","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Houston Does Not Believe In Tears"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"YATES, ANDREA"},{"name":"glocations","value":"HOUSTON (TEX)"},{"name":"organizations","value":"ENRON CORP"},{"name":"subject","value":"MURDERS AND ATTEMPTED MURDERS"},{"name":"subject","value":"GEOGRAPHIC PROFILES"},{"name":"subject","value":"ALLISON (TROPICAL STORM)"},{"name":"subject","value":"FLOODS"},{"name":"subject","value":"HURRICANES AND TROPICAL STORMS"}],"pub_date":"2002-06-09T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Magazine Desk","section_name":"Magazine","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Randall","rank":1,"lastname":"Patterson"}],"original":"By Randall Patterson"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd2329f8eb7c8105d7c233a","word_count":3231,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2002\/05\/09\/business\/lawyers-for-california-doubt-effect-of-enron-memos.html","snippet":"Though California state officials crowed over the Enron memos released this week outlining questionable strategies for wringing profits from the electricity market here, state lawyers said that the documents would probably have only a modest and i...","lead_paragraph":"Though California state officials crowed over the Enron memos released this week outlining questionable strategies for wringing profits from the electricity market here, state lawyers said that the documents would probably have only a modest and indirect effect on their efforts to win refunds from the power generators.
