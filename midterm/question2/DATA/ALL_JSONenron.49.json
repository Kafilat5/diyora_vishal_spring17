I recall that when I took a required course in business ethics in the late 1980's, students had very little interest in the course.

He arrived with a chauffeur, and afterward, he treated a group of 20 or so classmates to drinks at Giacomo Jack's, a nearby restaurant. But those who grew up playing football and climbing trees with Mr. Baxter, 43, a former vice chairman of Enron, said they were shocked to learn that he committed suicide in Texas last week.
