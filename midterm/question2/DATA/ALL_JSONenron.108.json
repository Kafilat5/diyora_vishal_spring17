Enron, based in Houston, was widely expected to seek bankruptcy protection. With $62 billion in assets as of Sept. 30, it would be the biggest American company ever to go bankrupt, dwarfing the filing by Texaco in 1987. Late in the day, though, Enron's chief financial officer, Jeff McMahon, said that the company was still talking to banks about a restructuring and considering other options.","abstract":"Enron, champion of energy deregulation that grew into one of nation's 10 largest companies, collapses after rival Dynegy backs out of deal to buy it and many big trading partners stop doing business with it; is widely expected to seek bankruptcy protection; would be biggest American company ever to go bankrupt; stock price graph; photo (M)","print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"ENRON COLLAPSES AS SUITOR CANCELS PLANS FOR MERGER","kicker":"ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE OVERVIEW"},"keywords":[{"name":"organizations","value":"DYNEGY INC"},{"name":"organizations","value":"ENRON CORP"},{"name":"subject","value":"MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES"},{"name":"subject","value":"BANKRUPTCIES"}],"pub_date":"2001-11-29T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Business\/Financial Desk","section_name":"Front Page; Business","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"qualifier":"Jr.","firstname":"Richard","middlename":"A.","lastname":"OPPEL","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""},{"firstname":"Andrew","middlename":"Ross","lastname":"SORKIN","rank":2,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By RICHARD A.

Another says that he would like to see Kenneth Lay -- then Enron's chief executive -- wind up as energy secretary in the new Bush administration. An exhaustive study released by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in March 2003 confirmed what everyone had long suspected -- that Enron and other major energy companies manipulated California's energy markets in 2000 and 2001 in ways that cost the state billions.
