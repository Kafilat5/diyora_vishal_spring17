That's fine with its preppy residents, who would just as soon not be noticed. The rapper 50 Cent found it and joined its mansion-owning crowd in 2004. Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis knew her way around the place, too, as did her sister, Lee Radziwill, and her White House social secretary, Letitia Baldrige, as well as Gene Tierney and Lilly Pulitzer -- all of whom attended Miss Porter's, the fancy girls' boarding school that occupies much of the historical village center. And behind Farmington's prosperous-looking facade of tree-lined residential streets and sedate-looking buildings, there are discoveries for the casual visitor: a collection of Impressionist art, a look at the modern incarnation of the young Jacqueline Bouvier's school, traces of kidnapped Africans' rebellion on the slave ship Amistad.","abstract":null,"print_page":"9","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"A 'Village of Pretty Houses,' Where Women's Lives Were Reshaped","kicker":"DAY TRIP"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"CONNECTICUT"},{"name":"subject","value":"TRAVEL AND VACATIONS"}],"pub_date":"2006-03-03T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Escapes","section_name":"Travel","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Eve","lastname":"GLASBERG"}],"original":"By EVE GLASBERG"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd2782f8eb7c8105d839dee","word_count":1324,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2014\/10\/19\/travel\/things-to-do-in-36-hours-in-athens.html","snippet":"The city\u2019s self-confidence and creativity are stirring again after years of tough press that defined Athens as a beleaguered capital....","lead_paragraph":"The city\u2019s self-confidence and creativity are stirring again after years of tough press that defined Athens as a beleaguered capital.","abstract":"Joanna Kakissis travel article on 36-hour visit to Athens.","print_page":"11","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"width":190,"url":"images\/2014\/10\/12\/travel\/12-hours-acropolis\/12-hours-acropolis-thumbWide.jpg","height":126,"subtype":"wide","legacy":{"wide":"images\/2014\/10\/12\/travel\/12-hours-acropolis\/12-hours-acropolis-thumbWide.jpg","wideheight":"126","widewidth":"190"},"type":"image"},{"width":600,"url":"images\/2014\/10\/12\/travel\/12-hours-acropolis\/12-hours-acropolis-articleLarge.jpg","height":386,"subtype":"xlarge","legacy":{"xlargewidth":"600","xlarge":"images\/2014\/10\/12\/travel\/12-hours-acropolis\/12-hours-acropolis-articleLarge.jpg","xlargeheight":"386"},"type":"image"},{"width":75,"url":"images\/2014\/10\/12\/travel\/12-hours-acropolis\/12-hours-acropolis-thumbStandard.jpg","height":75,"subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"thumbnailheight":"75","thumbnail":"images\/2014\/10\/12\/travel\/12-hours-acropolis\/12-hours-acropolis-thumbStandard.jpg","thumbnailwidth":"75"},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"36 Hours in Athens","content_kicker":"Weekend Guide","kicker":"Weekend Guide","print_headline":"36 Hours in Athens"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","is_major":"Y","name":"subject","value":"Travel and Vacations"},{"rank":"2","is_major":"Y","name":"glocations","value":"Athens (Greece)"}],"pub_date":"2014-10-19T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Travel","section_name":"Travel","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"contributor":"","person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Joanna","rank":1,"lastname":"KAKISSIS"}],"original":"By JOANNA KAKISSIS"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"543ea32138f0d853e89f653f","word_count":"1499","slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/abstract.html?res=9F05E4DF1F3CE03ABC4953DFB2668383659EDE","snippet":"WARSAW, Poland, March 31 -- A Polish Foreign Office spokesman gave official backing today to a statement in the Polish press that retaliatory measures might be taken against United States correspondents in Poland because of the United States refus...","lead_paragraph":"WARSAW, Poland, March 31 -- A Polish Foreign Office spokesman gave official backing today to a statement in the Polish press that retaliatory measures might be taken against United States correspondents in Poland because of the United States refusal to grant a visa to a Polish newspaperman.","abstract":"Poland urges reprisal for US ban on Polish newsman G Jaszunski","print_page":"2","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"POLES IMPLY BAN ON U.

Michael Meek, whose family has been in the retail luggage business in Denver for more than 110 years. ''It's like with cars,'' said Mr. Meek, president of the A. E. Meek Trunk and Baggage Company. ''A four-door sedan will do everything reasonably well, but it won't do special things. Sometimes a two-door subcompact or a station wagon will do much better.'' Harvey Maltz, owner of the Edward Harvey Company, which has two retail luggage stores in Boston, put it slightly differently. ''There is no such thing as a perfect suitcase,'' he said. ''You never take the same trip twice. You never go to the same place at the same time for the same purpose for the same length of time. So you reach out and you have all this luggage available at home, but you never have quite the right piece.'' Mr. Meek and Mr. Maltz are not suggesting that each time you travel, you buy new bags. Rather, they are making the point that 30 or so years ago the options were few - perhaps a wooden box-type suitcase, a matching set of several sizes or a two- or three-suiter. Today, however, the choices are extremely diverse. Go into a luggage shop, and chances are you will be faced with a wide array of brands, shapes, construction, types of covering materials, hardware and, of course, prices.","abstract":null,"print_page":"3","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"PICKING OUT THE RIGHT BAG TO PACK","kicker":"PRACTICAL TRAVELER"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"TRAVEL"},{"name":"subject","value":"LUGGAGE"}],"pub_date":"1984-09-23T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Travel Desk","section_name":"Travel","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Paul","rank":1,"lastname":"GRIMES"}],"original":"By PAUL GRIMES"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd13ab88eb7c8105d60faba","word_count":1331,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/abstract.html?res=9802EEDC103CE13BBC4F53DFB467838C659EDE","snippet":"PARIS -- The Mediterranean coast of France is preparing for its winter season after its most successful summer season since the war.

''I am a Copt,'' she said, pointing for corroboration to a badge on her lapel. Her given name was Christian. I was bound on a genealogical mission during a first visit to Egypt, not in search of my own roots, which lie in Europe, but of a cherished art object. I had acquired it in New York from the late C. Dikran Kelekian, one of the most esteemed dealers in Middle Eastern antiquities, who had a particular fondness for the brilliant polychrome Coptic textiles. My fifth-century fragment is the head of a woman with a heart-shaped face, kohl- rimmed eyes that follow me wherever I move in our living room and a giraffish neck such as Modigliani might have drawn a millenium and a half later. For years I have speculated about the mysteries behind her inscrutable gaze. Coptic - the name is a corruption of the Greek word for Egyptian - refers to the natives who adopted the teachings of St. Mark after his arrival in Alexandria in A.D. 61. Their descendants, a hearty minority of six million, now constitute about 12 percent of the population.","abstract":null,"print_page":"12","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"IN A CORNER OF CAIRO, A HAVEN FOR COPTIC ART"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"EGYPT, ARAB REPUBLIC OF"},{"name":"glocations","value":"CAIRO (EGYPT)"},{"name":"organizations","value":"COPTIC CHURCH"},{"name":"subject","value":"TRAVEL AND VACATIONS"}],"pub_date":"1985-04-21T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Travel Desk","section_name":"Travel","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Marylin","rank":1,"lastname":"BENDER"}],"original":"By MARYLIN BENDER; MARYLIN BENDER is a writer based in New York"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd1515b8eb7c8105d632c5b","word_count":2019,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1982\/06\/20\/travel\/ideal-isles-from-alpha-to-omega.html","snippet":"MARGOT GRANITSAS is a journalist and photographer who worked as a correspondent in Greece from 1977 to the end of 1981.

By MARGOT GRANITSAS Getting to know the roughly 200 inhabited Greek islands out of more than 3,000 could be a lifetime job, and a pleasant one. Few other places offer such diversity in locale, vegetation, architecture, human characteristics, habits or accommodations in a relatively small geographic area. From the cosmopolitan islands to the half-deserted; from those covered with lush greenery to others lying like a knuckle of a weather-worn hand in the blue sea; from the blindingly white villages of the Cyclades to the stately and ornate neoclassical mansions of Syros, there seems to be no end to their individuality. And, despite the fact that tourism has been a mixed blessing to the country, a good deal of this variety seems indestructible.
