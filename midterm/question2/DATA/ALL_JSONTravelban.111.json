Everywhere else, the Pope has been met by large and enthusiastic crowds. In the Netherlands, the crowds were small, the welcome lukewarm if not cold; people were talking back to the Pope. Through his extensive travels, John Paul had turned television into an important asset. This time, the pictures flashed around the world were of angry protesters clashing with the police. The demonstrations can be written off as a fairly common occurrence in a country where high unemployment and an enduring counterculture have created a substantial group of disaffected young people. But the demonstrations were in many ways the least of John Paul's problems. One shock the Vatican had to absorb was the willingness of the Dutch to make fun of the Pope. ''Popie Jopie,'' a satirical song about him, hit No. 3 on the charts. For weeks, a popular television program had run slapstick routines about a Pope who seems to have to travel everywhere in the world.","abstract":null,"print_page":"22","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"THE POPE PLAYS TO A TOUGH AUDIENCE","kicker":"IDEAS & TRENDS"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"POPE"},{"name":"glocations","value":"NETHERLANDS"},{"name":"organizations","value":"ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH"},{"name":"subject","value":"TRAVEL, PERSONAL"}],"pub_date":"1985-05-19T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Week in Review Desk","section_name":"Travel; Week in Review","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"qualifier":"Jr","firstname":"E.","middlename":"J.","lastname":"DIONNE","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By E.J.
