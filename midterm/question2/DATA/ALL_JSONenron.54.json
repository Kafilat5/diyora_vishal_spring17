Ties to people in power. Pain for the powerless. Offshore accounts are a big plus. And it is almost always the case that regulators failed to act, but promise to fix the problem so it will not happen again. Last week, the Enron affair, if it had not already, acquired all these trappings, and more. But plenty of questions remained about exactly what happened, about who was to blame for Enron's spectacular collapse and about the dealings the company had with Washington -- Congress and the White House alike.","abstract":"Chronology of events in Enron scandal in last week (M)1","print_page":"24","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"The Enron Debacle Follows a Now Established Format for Scandal","kicker":"ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE WEEK THAT WAS"},"keywords":[{"name":"organizations","value":"ENRON CORP"},{"name":"subject","value":"ACCOUNTING AND ACCOUNTANTS"},{"name":"subject","value":"ETHICS"},{"name":"subject","value":"BANKRUPTCIES"}],"pub_date":"2002-01-20T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"National Desk","section_name":"U.S.","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Tom","rank":1,"lastname":"REDBURN"}],"original":"By TOM REDBURN"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd21b2d8eb7c8105d79a258","word_count":779,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2002\/01\/20\/business\/economic-view-pension-bubble-loses-some-air.html","snippet":"THE late 1990's was a golden age for stocks -- and for Americans' potential retirement incomes.

Its executives reveled in the role, naming the Houston Astros stadium for their company, building a new office tower and writing checks for every civic cause. Through Enron, above all, Houston, long the capital of the world's oil industry, was extending its claim to natural gas and electricity. Suddenly, any tie to Enron has become a liability. In April 1999, Enron signed a 30-year, $100 million contract for the naming rights to the new baseball stadium. Today the Astros, are wondering what the future holds. ''It's really a sad day for Enron and for Houston,'' said Pam Gardner, the Astros' president for business operations. Though Enron is current on its payments, she said, ''It is all up in the air.''","abstract":"Enron Corp's collapse falls heavily on Houston, where it is headquartered; effects on city are felt in estate market, baseball, Houston's stadium, local philanthropy and white- and blue-collar workers, including Enron's 7,000 employees (M)","print_page":"11","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Community; A Crown Jewel Becomes a Liability"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"HOUSTON (TEX)"},{"name":"organizations","value":"ENRON CORP"},{"name":"subject","value":"BASEBALL"},{"name":"subject","value":"LABOR"},{"name":"subject","value":"PHILANTHROPY"},{"name":"subject","value":"REAL ESTATE"},{"name":"subject","value":"STADIUMS AND ARENAS"},{"name":"subject","value":"STOCKS AND BONDS"},{"name":"subject","value":"ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND TRENDS"}],"pub_date":"2001-12-02T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Money and Business\/Financial Desk","section_name":"Business","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Maureen","rank":1,"lastname":"BALLEZA"}],"original":"By MAUREEN BALLEZA"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd2526f8eb7c8105d7f8001","word_count":409,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2001\/11\/29\/business\/enron-s-collapse-the-chief-executive-foundation-gives-way-on-chief-s-big-dream.html","snippet":"Well before anyone could imagine that Enron might collapse, Kenneth L.

When the Feb. 12 issue featured a cover photo of Jeffrey Skilling, you knew bad things were about to happen both to Enron and to its new C.E.O. Sure enough, on Tuesday Mr. Skilling resigned for ''personal reasons.'' The next day he conceded that the most important of those personal reasons was the 50 percent drop in Enron's stock since January. Is this just another tale of extravagant expectations disappointed, the kind of story that has become all too common lately? No; this case has wider significance.
