The demolition cleared the way for a thriving shopping strip on Hayes Street, once bisected by the freeway and plagued by crime. Simultaneously, residents living in the shadow of the area's other elevated freeway ramp, on Fell Street, lobbied for its removal and replacement by an alternative Parisian-style thoroughfare: the brand-new Octavia Boulevard. This summer, the city inaugurated a recreational space, a 275-foot-long tree-lined stretch called Hayes Green Park, just another sign that once-seedy Hayes Valley had arrived.","abstract":"Bonnie Tsui travel article on revitalization of Hayes Valley, once run-down area of San Francisco, Calif, after earthquake-damaged ramps to old Central Freeway were torn down; photo; map (M)","print_page":"4","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"caption":"Hayes Valley","url":"imagepages\/2005\/09\/11\/travel\/20050911_SURF_map.html","rank":"2","height":325,"width":250,"legacy":{"MultimediaPopupHeight2":"325","MultimediaUrl2":"imagepages\/2005\/09\/11\/travel\/20050911_SURF_map.html","MultimediaPopupWidth2":"250","MultimediaHeadline2":"Hayes Valley","MultimediaType2":"Image"},"type":"Image"},{"url":"imagepages\/2005\/09\/11\/travel\/11surface.1.html","rank":"1","height":325,"width":250,"legacy":{"MultimediaPopupWidth1":"250","MultimediaPopupHeight1":"325","MultimediaUrl1":"imagepages\/2005\/09\/11\/travel\/11surface.1.html","MultimediaType1":"Image"},"type":"Image"}],"headline":{"main":"After a Freeway's Collapse, Growth","kicker":"SURFACING | SAN FRANCISCO"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"SAN FRANCISCO (CALIF)"},{"name":"glocations","value":"CALIFORNIA"},{"name":"subject","value":"TRAVEL AND VACATIONS"}],"pub_date":"2005-09-11T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Travel Desk","section_name":"Travel","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Bonnie","lastname":"TSUI"}],"original":"By BONNIE TSUI"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd2863a8eb7c8105d856fe0","word_count":510,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/abstract.html?res=9B07E5DF1F3CE731A25755C0A9639C946092D6CF","snippet":"WHERE to go for a holiday whether a week-end trip or a month's motor tour-does not have to  be decided by guesswork.

The sound of upcountry music, the rare scent of fresh earth or flowers, or the sight of hill tribe people in traditional dress squatting in front of a video shop are reminders that beyond this polluted, traffic-clogged city, there is another Thailand. It can be found in almost any direction: north to the cool mountains, south along an endless seacoast, west into peaceful river valleys, northeast into the majestic world of the Mekong. Although the number of tourists traveling beyond Bangkok from Japan, Hong Kong and Europe is increasing, this is a country that is mostly still off the tourist track, while easily manageable for independent travelers. Visitors willing to put up with some fairly basic hotels and eating places enjoy in return remarkably varied scenery and the atmosphere of a nation reflecting Sinetic, Indic and Malay cultures, yet always very Thai. That means Thai (or Chinese-Thai) food in every town, and the ubiquitous enthusiasm with which Thais try to please visitors.","abstract":null,"print_page":"13","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"ON RURAL ROUTES THROUGH THAILAND"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"THAILAND"},{"name":"subject","value":"TRAVEL AND VACATIONS"}],"pub_date":"1986-12-21T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Travel Desk","section_name":"Travel","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Barbara","rank":1,"lastname":"CROSSETTE"}],"original":"By BARBARA CROSSETTE; Barbara Crossette is the Bangkok bureau chief of The New York Times"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd164e18eb7c8105d6514d2","word_count":2592,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/abstract.html?res=950DE2DA1E3AE73ABC4153DFB4668383649EDE","snippet":"NASSAU, Bahamas -- This coral - studded British island resort is back in business again as a major winter-vacation center.
