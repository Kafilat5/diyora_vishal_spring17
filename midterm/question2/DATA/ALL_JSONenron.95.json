Mark has hardly been presented as a friend of India. Ms. Mark has been widely cast here as a robber baron for her role in winning the Enron Development Corporation, a subsidiary of the Houston-based energy company, a contract to build India's largest-ever power plant. After Enron had spent nearly $300 million, the project was canceled last month by nationalist politicians in Maharashtra state who said India didn't need the plant. So when Ms. Mark left her New Delhi hotel on a recent afternoon to visit the India Gate, a soldiers' memorial that is one of the capital's principal landmarks, it was a surprise to find her surrounded by well-wishers. One man, Rakesh Aggarwal, a New Delhi lawyer sightseeing with his family, put it simply: \"Personally, I think India needs power.\" American Assumptions There is a lesson in this for American companies, and for all outsiders approaching India as it reaches for a new relationship with the world. Many companies responding to India's market-based economic reforms have behaved as if they had read a standard primer on India -- a country that is desperately poor, 60 percent illiterate, but unusual among Asian nations in being a thriving democracy, having English as its common language and a proven legal system. From this, they have assumed a congenial environment for investment.","abstract":null,"print_page":"3","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"The World; India Repels an Invasion of Money"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"INDIA"},{"name":"organizations","value":"ENRON DEVELOPMENT CORP"},{"name":"subject","value":"FOREIGN INVESTMENTS"},{"name":"subject","value":"POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT"},{"name":"subject","value":"CONTRACTS"},{"name":"subject","value":"ELECTRIC LIGHT AND POWER"},{"name":"subject","value":"ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND TRENDS"}],"pub_date":"1995-09-24T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Week in Review Desk","section_name":"Week in Review","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"John","middlename":"F.","lastname":"BURNS","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By JOHN F.
