Though regulators say the markets generally responded well after the collapse, Enron's downfall has prompted calls from many officials, including some staunch deregulation advocates, for more oversight and transparency. Last month, at the urging of senators from California, Oregon and Washington, Patrick H. Wood III, chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, agreed to investigate whether Enron's dominance of the market for long-term power contracts and energy derivatives played any role in California's energy crisis a year ago. Mr. Wood has been pushing the commission to improve its monitoring ability, creating a new office to respond to concerns about market abuses.","abstract":"Enron Corp's collapse has reignited debate about how closely Congress and regulators should watch nation's recently deregulated electricity markets (M)","print_page":"13","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"How Will Washington Read the Signs?; Watching Deregulation"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"UNITED STATES"},{"name":"organizations","value":"ENRON CORP"},{"name":"subject","value":"ACCOUNTING AND ACCOUNTANTS"},{"name":"subject","value":"ETHICS"},{"name":"subject","value":"LAW AND LEGISLATION"},{"name":"subject","value":"ELECTRIC LIGHT AND POWER"},{"name":"subject","value":"REGULATION AND DEREGULATION OF INDUSTRY"},{"name":"subject","value":"BANKRUPTCIES"}],"pub_date":"2002-02-10T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Money and Business\/Financial Desk","section_name":"Business","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"qualifier":"Jr","firstname":"Richard","middlename":"A.","lastname":"Oppel","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By Richard A.

Bush's largest campaign contributor, failed to show up to testify before Congress, I became convinced that it is time to appoint a special counsel to investigate Enron. We need to name a special counsel, rather than relying on the Justice Department, because conflicts of interest abound in this case, particularly at the Justice Department. Federal law allows the attorney general to appoint such a counsel when the Justice Department's involvement would present a conflict of interest. Attorney General John Ashcroft recused himself from the Enron case because he had taken $57,000 from Enron in his failed bid for the Senate in 2000. His chief of staff also recused himself, since he was Mr. Ashcroft's 2000 campaign manager. That leaves Larry Thompson, deputy attorney general, to oversee the case -- or to appoint a special counsel.","abstract":"time for","print_page":"19","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Time for A Special Counsel"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"LAY, KENNETH W"},{"name":"organizations","value":"ENRON CORP"},{"name":"subject","value":"SPECIAL PROSECUTORS (INDEPENDENT COUNSEL)"}],"pub_date":"2002-02-09T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Editorial Desk","section_name":"Opinion","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"Ernest","middlename":"F.","lastname":"Hollings","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By Ernest F.
