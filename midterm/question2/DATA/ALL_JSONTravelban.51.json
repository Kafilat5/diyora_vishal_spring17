places should envy, on its absolute ban of the motor vehicle in favor of the bicycle and horse. But Mackinac Island, a six-square-mile dot of Michigan in upper Lake Huron, is much more, one of those unusual resorts whose attractions are more than a match for the words of its brochure writers. ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. is a reporter in the Washington bureau of The Times. It has military and commercial history - the fort overlooking the chief settlement was built to defend the fur business that made John Jacob Astor the country's first millionaire - a sedate way of life that has changed little since Chicago meat barons began making it their playground a century ago and marine beauty almost in the shadow of the Mackinac Bridge, the world's third longest suspension bridge. The island also has, as local residents will tell you, probably the continent's cleanest, most pollen-free air.
