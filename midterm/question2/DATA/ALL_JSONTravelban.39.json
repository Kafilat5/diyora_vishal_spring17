In exchange for surrendering his seat, Mr. Adkins had been offered a free ticket and an upgrade to first class on a later flight. ''But right before the doors closed on the next flight,'' Mr. Adkins, a university research director, recalled, ''a customer service agent boarded the plane and told me I needed to get off because I had been upgraded illegally.

The Cologne authorities said Mr. Kaplan must report each week to the local police and may not leave the city.

A D\u00fcsseldorf court on Tuesday rejected Turkey's request to have Mr. Kaplan extradited, but the German government has said it would try to expel him on different grounds. The court said it had refused Turkey's extradition request and ordered Mr. Kaplan to be freed from detention. He had been held pending a decision on extradition since completing a four-year jail term for calling for the murder of a rival religious leader.","abstract":"Cologne, Germany, places travel ban on Islamic militant Metin Kaplan after Dusseldorf court rejects Turkish bid to have him extradited to face treason charges in connection with 1998 plot (S)","print_page":"7","blog":[],"source":"Reuters","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"TRAVEL BAN IMPOSED","kicker":"BRIEFLY NOTED: GERMANY"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"KAPLAN, METIN"},{"name":"glocations","value":"GERMANY"},{"name":"glocations","value":"COLOGNE (GERMANY)"},{"name":"glocations","value":"TURKEY"},{"name":"subject","value":"TREASON"},{"name":"subject","value":"EXTRADITION"},{"name":"subject","value":"TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"TERRORISM"}],"pub_date":"2003-05-31T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign Desk","section_name":"World","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd23fcc8eb7c8105d7d7239","word_count":"235","slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/intransit.blogs.nytimes.com\/2009\/06\/30\/honduras-travel-ban\/","snippet":"The State Department is recommending that American citizens defer all non-essential travel to Honduras following the military ousting of President Manuel Zelaya....","lead_paragraph":"The State Department issued a travel alert on Monday recommending that American citizens defer all non-essential travel to Honduras following the military ousting of President Manuel Zelaya in a coup on Sunday.","abstract":"The State Department is recommending that American citizens defer all non-essential travel to Honduras following the military ousting of President Manuel Zelaya.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Honduras Travel Ban","kicker":"In Transit"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","name":"type_of_material","value":"News"}],"pub_date":"2009-06-30T12:04:25Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":"Travel","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Michelle","rank":1,"lastname":"HIGGINS"}],"original":"By MICHELLE HIGGINS"},"type_of_material":"Blog","_id":"4fd395e98eb7c8105d8cc726","word_count":187,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/abstract.html?res=9D01E4DC1730E23BBC4152DFB266838C649EDE","snippet":null,"lead_paragraph":null,"abstract":null,"print_page":"2","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Travel Ban Is Wide","kicker":"1"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"1957-04-19T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":null,"section_name":null,"subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Article","_id":"4fc3bf2f45c1498b0d831265","word_count":80,"slideshow_credits":null}]},"status":"OK","copyright":"Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
