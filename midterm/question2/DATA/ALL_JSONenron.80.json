Mr. Fastow, the former chief financial officer of Enron who helped mastermind the company's fraud, will now become a cooperating witness as prosecutors put other former Enron officials on trial. With his help, the government also has a better chance of indicting Jeffrey Skilling and Kenneth Lay, the energy-trading company's former top bosses. Leslie Caldwell, the lead prosecutor brought in after federal prosecutors in Houston recused themselves, deserves credit for painstakingly building a case against Mr. Fastow. Mr. Fastow was indicted on 98 counts of fraud more than a year ago, but in the end it appears to have been the indictment of his wife, who had also been an Enron employee, that forced him to succumb. Because they have young children, the married couple's primary concern was not to serve jail time at the same time.","abstract":"Editorial on big win for federal prosecutors in guilty pleas by Andrew Fastow, who masterminded Enron fraud, and his wife Lea","print_page":"32","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"A Family Pleads Guilty"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"FASTOW, LEA"},{"name":"persons","value":"FASTOW, ANDREW"},{"name":"organizations","value":"ENRON CORP"},{"name":"subject","value":"FRAUDS AND SWINDLING"},{"name":"subject","value":"ACCOUNTING AND ACCOUNTANTS"},{"name":"subject","value":"TAX EVASION"},{"name":"subject","value":"PLEA BARGAINING"},{"name":"subject","value":"EDITORIALS"},{"name":"subject","value":"ETHICS"},{"name":"subject","value":"BANKRUPTCIES"}],"pub_date":"2004-01-15T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Editorial Desk","section_name":"Opinion","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Editorial","_id":"4fd23c118eb7c8105d7d1462","word_count":350,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2003\/11\/25\/business\/bankruptcy-examiner-finds-enron-s-top-leaders-neglectful.html","snippet":"The former top two executives of Enron as well as former directors, accountants and inside and outside lawyers are in ''a circle of responsibility for Enron's financial demise'' whether or not they are legally culpable, an examiner appointed by th...","lead_paragraph":"The former top two executives of Enron as well as former directors, accountants and inside and outside lawyers are in ''a circle of responsibility for Enron's financial demise'' whether or not they are legally culpable, an examiner appointed by the bankruptcy court has concluded.
