Although Enron's executives and accountants have much to answer for, they can be forgiven for cracking a wry smile when members of Congress begin lecturing them on their dereliction of duty: Congress itself, as much as Enron and Arthur Andersen, bears some responsibility for the current state of affairs. The story begins in the 1970's and 1980's, when members of Congress, most from oil-producing states, pressured the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission not to demand tougher standards for financial reporting in the petroleum industry. At the time, it was clear that the lawmakers were serving corporate interests, not those of investors. Now it's clear that this was only a warm-up act.","abstract":"Op-Ed article by Michael H Granof and Stephen A Zeff on upcoming Congressional hearings into Enron Corp bankruptcy says Congress itself, as much as Enron and Arthur Andersen accounting firm, bears some responsibility for not demanding tougher standards for corporate financial reporting; history of how Congress set stage for Enron's failure reviewed (M)","print_page":"19","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Unaccountable in Washington"},"keywords":[{"name":"organizations","value":"ENRON CORP"},{"name":"organizations","value":"ANDERSEN, ARTHUR"},{"name":"subject","value":"ACCOUNTING AND ACCOUNTANTS"},{"name":"subject","value":"REGULATION AND DEREGULATION OF INDUSTRY"},{"name":"subject","value":"COMPANY REPORTS"},{"name":"subject","value":"BANKRUPTCIES"}],"pub_date":"2002-01-23T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Editorial Desk","section_name":"Opinion","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"Michael","middlename":"H.","lastname":"Granof","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""},{"firstname":"Stephen","middlename":"A.","lastname":"Zeff","rank":2,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By Michael H.
