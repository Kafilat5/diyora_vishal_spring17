Built in the 1920's and redesigned by the renowned Cuban architect Max Borges Recio in 1953, it is one of the most perfect futuristic constructions in Latin America (despite an uncanny resemblance to Terminal 4 at Kennedy International Airport). The exquisite portico and vaulted ceiling have survived without a crack. But unfortunately, most Americans will never get to sip mojitos poolside. Those lucky enough to wrangle a visa will run into Castro's recent ban on dollars. (He has imposed a maddening 10 percent surtax on the now-mandatory exchange for ''peso convertibles.'') Even if you manage to cut through all the Communist red tape, you still probably won't make it past the guards. Invitations are rare unless you've got juice with a former Olympian or one of the high-ranking party members who dominate the current list. Then again, you can always put some of those extra peso convertibles to use.

Europeans and Canadians flock to Cuba in as normal a fashion as Americans do to the Bahamas. Passell points out that Americans are going there anyway, either by slipping surreptitiously through Canada or Mexico or by claiming that they are journalists or researchers. He assures readers that as long as you go quietly, \"the chance of getting caught is roughly equal to the risk of being abducted by aliens.\" Well, our group of 175 people who traveled to Cuba in October did not go quietly, and we refused to lie. We said that we were ordinary citizens who wanted to visit Cuba and who felt we had the constitutional right to do so.","abstract":null,"print_page":"20","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"FORBIDDEN SUN, AND SIN, COMMUNIST STYLE"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"CUBA"},{"name":"subject","value":"TRAVEL AND VACATIONS"}],"pub_date":"1993-12-05T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Magazine Desk","section_name":"Magazine; Opinion","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Letter","_id":"4fd1addb8eb7c8105d6ce757","word_count":175,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/reuters\/2015\/04\/14\/world\/asia\/14reuters-southkorea-japan.html","snippet":"South Korea lifted a travel ban on a Japanese journalist on trial for a charge of defaming South Korean President Park Geun-hye, a prosecution official said on Tuesday, removing what has been an irritant in bilateral relations....","lead_paragraph":"South Korea lifted a travel ban on a Japanese journalist on trial for a charge of defaming South Korean President Park Geun-hye, a prosecution official said on Tuesday, removing what has been an irritant in bilateral relations.","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"Reuters","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"South Korea Lifts Travel Ban on Japanese Journalist in Defamation Trial","print_headline":"South Korea Lifts Travel Ban on Japanese Journalist in Defamation Trial"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2015-04-14T01:47:16Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"None","section_name":"World","subsection_name":"Asia Pacific","byline":{"person":[],"original":"By REUTERS","organization":"REUTERS"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"552caa8338f0d8273c42866c","word_count":"446","slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/reuters\/2014\/10\/06\/world\/africa\/06reuters-health-ebola-usa.html","snippet":"President Barack Obama said on Monday that the government would develop expanded screening of airline passengers for Ebola, both in the West African countries hit by the disease and the United States....","lead_paragraph":"President Barack Obama said on Monday that the government would develop expanded screening of airline passengers for Ebola, both in the West African countries hit by the disease and the United States.","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"Reuters","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"U.S. Working on New Screenings for Ebola but No Travel Ban","print_headline":"U.S. Working on New Screenings for Ebola but No Travel Ban"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2014-10-06T02:08:37Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":null,"section_name":"World","subsection_name":"Africa","byline":{"person":[],"original":"By REUTERS","organization":"REUTERS"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"5432324438f0d85b58978ee3","word_count":"862","slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/abstract.html?res=9406E0DB163BE53ABC4852DFB766838C649EDE","snippet":null,"lead_paragraph":null,"abstract":null,"print_page":"9","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"U.S. LIFTS TRAVEL BAN; Hallinan Was Told Five Years Ago Not to Go Abroad","kicker":"1"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"1957-01-10T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":null,"section_name":null,"subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1}],"original":"Special to The New York Times"},"type_of_material":"Article","_id":"4fc3ca4345c1498b0d8643cf","word_count":172,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/abstract.html?res=9903EEDB143DE23BBC4152DFBF668388649EDE","snippet":null,"lead_paragraph":null,"abstract":null,"print_page":"5","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"NEW TRAVEL BAN OFFER; Allies Ask East German Bars Be Let Down Sept. 30","kicker":"1"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"1953-09-19T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":null,"section_name":null,"subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1}],"original":"Special to THE NEW YORK TIMES"},"type_of_material":"Article","_id":"4fc3a47045c1498b0d7b48f6","word_count":169,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/abstract.html?res=9B04E2DE1438E33BBC4A52DFBF668388659EDE","snippet":"THE katydid has been at it for some time now -- its strident rasping reminding all that the frost will soon be on the pumpkin.
