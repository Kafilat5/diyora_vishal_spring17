This week Bernard Ebbers, the former WorldCom chief executive and one of the \u00fcberdealmakers of the bubbly 1990's, was hauled into a Manhattan courthouse in handcuffs and charged with orchestrating an $11 billion fraud, the biggest ever in the nation. Scores of federal prosecutors have methodically dissected these hugely complex securities and accounting misdeeds and brought charges against those responsible. In the WorldCom and Enron cases, which involved management schemes to prop up stock prices with largely fictitious financial reports, prosecutors were able to pressure the companies' chief financial officers into pleading guilty and agreeing to cooperate against their bosses. These chief financial officers still face significant jail time.","abstract":"Editorial contends that Enron and WorldCom prosecutions are important epilogue to greed that fed end-of-millennium financial mania; maintains they put top corporate officials on notice that if crimes take place on their watch, their underlings and outside advisers may not be only ones facing jail time","print_page":"14","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Courtroom Tales; . . . and Epic Frauds"},"keywords":[{"name":"organizations","value":"WORLDCOM INC"},{"name":"organizations","value":"ENRON CORP"},{"name":"subject","value":"FRAUDS AND SWINDLING"},{"name":"subject","value":"ACCOUNTING AND ACCOUNTANTS"},{"name":"subject","value":"SECURITIES AND COMMODITIES VIOLATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"EDITORIALS"},{"name":"subject","value":"ETHICS"}],"pub_date":"2004-03-06T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Editorial Desk","section_name":"Opinion","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Editorial","_id":"4fd27d4f8eb7c8105d8448ce","word_count":276,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2003\/10\/05\/business\/market-watch-lopsided-401-k-s-all-too-common.html","snippet":"IN a ruling last week, Judge Melinda Harmon of Federal District Court in Houston put corporate executives on notice that they may be responsible if their employees' 401(k) plans are destroyed by fraud or mismanagement.

Bush looked frustrated when news of WorldCom's monster con game reached the hilltop in Canada where heads of the world's biggest economies were gathering. Long gone are the days when a triumphal American leader could attend these summit conferences and gloat about the superiority of our home-grown capitalism. Even President Vladimir Putin of Russia was moved to express grave concern about American accounting practices. WorldCom, the telecommunications giant, reported late Tuesday that it had overstated its operating cash flow by $3.8 billion in the last five quarters, by improperly booking ordinary expenses as capital expenditures to be depreciated over time. Even a child can understand that painting your house is not the same as building a new one, but that basic concept seems to have eluded the people who were paid to keep an eye on WorldCom's books. It's no wonder that Europeans are now beginning to recoil from America's demand that the rest of the world adopt the accounting principles used in the United States.","abstract":"Editorial entitled WorldCom, WorldCon on 'monster' fraud perpetrated by telecommunications giant, which overstated its operating cash flow by $3.8 billion in last five quarters; points out that simple nature yet breathtaking scale of WorldCom's deceit raises anew all the Enron questions about failure of market guardians to prevent it","print_page":"26","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"WorldCom, WorldCon"},"keywords":[{"name":"organizations","value":"WORLDCOM INC"},{"name":"organizations","value":"ENRON CORP"},{"name":"subject","value":"FRAUDS AND SWINDLING"},{"name":"subject","value":"ACCOUNTING AND ACCOUNTANTS"},{"name":"subject","value":"UNITED STATES ECONOMY"},{"name":"subject","value":"EDITORIALS"},{"name":"subject","value":"ETHICS"},{"name":"subject","value":"REGULATION AND DEREGULATION OF INDUSTRY"},{"name":"subject","value":"COMPANY REPORTS"},{"name":"subject","value":"BANKRUPTCIES"}],"pub_date":"2002-06-28T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Editorial Desk","section_name":"Opinion","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Editorial","_id":"4fd269ee8eb7c8105d8212d1","word_count":683,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2002\/05\/06\/us\/democrats-take-aim-at-offshore-tax-havens.html","snippet":"Trying to burnish their credentials as the champions of underdogs and the scourge of the privileged, Democrats in Congress and around the country are promoting legislation that would prevent American companies from avoiding taxes by reincorporatin...","lead_paragraph":"Trying to burnish their credentials as the champions of underdogs and the scourge of the privileged, Democrats in Congress and around the country are promoting legislation that would prevent American companies from avoiding taxes by reincorporating in offshore tax havens.
