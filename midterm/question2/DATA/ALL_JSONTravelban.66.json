The mystical island is forever linked to the lure of escape across the water and refuge, epitomized by the flight of Bonnie Prince Charlie in 1746 and the haunting Scottish ballad \"Over the Sea to Skye.\" Ever since the days of the Viking hegemony in A.D. 800 -- and before, for that matter -- the only way to get here has been by boat. Never mind that the strait between Kyle of Lochalsh on the mainland and Kyleakin is disappointingly narrow, enough almost to yell across were it not for the howling wind. Tourists delight in pouring aboard the small ferry for the 10-minute ride, sometimes even singing: \"Speed bonnie boat, like a bird on the wing.\"","abstract":null,"print_page":"3","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Over the Sea To Skye, On a Toll Bridge","kicker":"TRAVEL ADVISORY: CORRESPONDENT'S REPORT"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"SKYE (SCOTLAND)"},{"name":"subject","value":"BRIDGES AND TUNNELS"},{"name":"subject","value":"TOLLS"},{"name":"subject","value":"TRAVEL AND VACATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"NYTRAVEL"}],"pub_date":"1995-07-09T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Travel Desk","section_name":null,"subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"John","rank":1,"lastname":"DARNTON"}],"original":"By JOHN DARNTON"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd1ce278eb7c8105d705aec","word_count":761,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1996\/10\/20\/travel\/abuzz-about-flights-over-the-grand-canyon.html","snippet":"WHEN President Clinton designated 1.7 million acres of Utah red rock county as a national monument last month, he spoke of the need to preserve places of beauty and solitude.

It was a familiar refrain; on Earth Day (April 22), Mr. Clinton said that low-flying aircraft over national parks could ''mar the natural beauty of the parks and create significant noise problems as well.'' Before long, the Department of Transportation proposed regulations for reducing noise from sightseeing aircraft over Grand Canyon National Park, resulting in a shouting match between environmentalists and the air tour business. Public hearings were held on the rules in Las Vegas and Scottsdale, Ariz., and the Federal Aviation Administration is expected to issue final regulations by year's end.","abstract":"Article on Transportation Dept proposals for reducing noise from sightseeing aircraft over Grand Canyon National Park (M)","print_page":"3","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Abuzz About Flights Over the Grand Canyon","kicker":"TRAVEL ADVISORY: CORRESPONDENT'S REPORT"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"GRAND CANYON NATIONAL PARK"},{"name":"organizations","value":"TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT"},{"name":"subject","value":"AIRLINES AND AIRPLANES"},{"name":"subject","value":"NOISE"}],"pub_date":"1996-10-20T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Travel Desk","section_name":null,"subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Edwin","rank":1,"lastname":"McDOWELL"}],"original":"By EDWIN McDOWELL"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd208df8eb7c8105d774365","word_count":884,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1994\/05\/01\/travel\/travel-advisory-correpondent-s-report-empty-pedestal-rome-fuels-debate-over.html","snippet":"On the Campidoglio in Rome stands an empty pedestal, a forlorn marble stump making the square, which was designed by Michelangelo, into a kind of eye without a pupil.

In 1981, a statue of the philosopher-emperor Marcus Aurelius that had been put there in 1538 by Michelangelo was removed for restoration. In 1990, the statue was restored to the Campidoglio, not to its original pedestal, but to an air-conditioned glass box in the nearby Capitoline Museum. Since then, debate has raged about whether the emperor should remain in his glass cage, or be restored to the original base. Experts say that even clean rainwater would have a corrosive effect on the statue's 1,800-year-old bronze skin. Rome's polluted elements would be devastating, they say.","abstract":null,"print_page":"3","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Empty Pedestal in Rome Fuels Debate Over Statue","kicker":"TRAVEL ADVISORY: CORREPONDENT'S REPORT"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"MICHELANGELO BUONARROTI"},{"name":"glocations","value":"ITALY"},{"name":"glocations","value":"ROME (ITALY)"},{"name":"subject","value":"HISTORIC BUILDINGS AND SITES"},{"name":"subject","value":"RESTORATION AND REHABILITATION"},{"name":"subject","value":"MONUMENTS AND MEMORIALS"},{"name":"subject","value":"ART"},{"name":"subject","value":"NYTRAVEL"}],"pub_date":"1994-05-01T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Travel Desk","section_name":null,"subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"John","rank":1,"lastname":"TAGLIABUE"}],"original":"By JOHN TAGLIABUE"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd1ebd88eb7c8105d73c4fe","word_count":706,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1995\/11\/26\/travel\/travel-advisory-correspondent-s-report-visitors-venturing-back-to-san-cristobal.html","snippet":"BEFORE New Year's Day 1994, this cobbled city, cradled in a valley surrounded by a pine-rimmed sierra, was a regular stop on the itineraries of certain hardy  travelers.

But to those drawn also by the labyrinthine mysteries within, there is bad news: One by one, their cramped passageways are being closed, at least temporarily, to tourists. The latest of the Pyramids to be shut is Mycerinus (also known as Menkaure), the third and smallest of the behemoths on the outskirts of Cairo. Archeologists had discovered that the moisture exhaled by the mounting number of tourists exploring the poorly ventilated chambers had raised humidity to dangerous levels, despoiling the structure by causing crystallized salt to line the walls and beginning to blacken them with fungi. The danger, according to Zahi Hawass, the director of the Pyramids and one who would prefer that they all be closed to tourists permanently, is that the salt can begin to crack and irrevocably weaken the 4,500-year-old structures, which are among the oldest surviving left by man.","abstract":"Egypt closes Mycerinus, one of Great Pyramids of Giza, to tourists for repairs;
