Lay said he was stepping aside to ensure the survival of the company. But as Enron tries to sort through creditors' claims and to tally the billions of dollars in debt parked off its balance sheet, its chances of surviving, even in a greatly diminished form, remain far from certain. The creditors' committee, which represents the big banks and other companies Enron owes, wants to extract the greatest value from the assets remaining. So do the company's own lawyers. But to do so probably will require selling off most, if not all, of what the company still owns, industry analysts and energy executives said.","abstract":"Enron Corp's chances of surviving, even in greatly diminished form, remain far from certain as Enron tries to sort thorugh creditors' claims and tally billions of dollars in debt on its balance sheet; creditors' committee, which represents big banks and other companies Enron owes, wants to extract greatest value from assets remaining (M)","print_page":"7","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Trying to Salvage What Can Be Salvaged While the Creditors Line Up","kicker":"ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE COMPANY'S FUTURE"},"keywords":[{"name":"organizations","value":"ENRON CORP"},{"name":"subject","value":"ACCOUNTING AND ACCOUNTANTS"},{"name":"subject","value":"ETHICS"},{"name":"subject","value":"BANKRUPTCIES"}],"pub_date":"2002-01-25T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Business\/Financial Desk","section_name":"Business","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Neela","rank":1,"lastname":"BANERJEE"}],"original":"By NEELA BANERJEE"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd26da98eb7c8105d8275f4","word_count":842,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2002\/01\/23\/opinion\/l-enron-and-the-culture-of-greed-266779.html","snippet":"To the Editor:    Re ''The United States of Enron,'' by Frank Rich (column, Jan. 19):    Ann Richards, the former Texas governor, is exactly right; the Enron scandal calls for a special prosecutor.

That was what Enron's enemies called the company when its phalanxes of lobbyists swept through Washington and state capitals in the late 1990's, aggressively and meticulously arguing in favor of loosening the electricity industry from a century of government control. While other power companies fought deregulation as a threat to their very existence, Enron was quick to see the opportunities, and it devoted much money and labor to shaping the progress of changes on the federal and local levels. As deregulation moved ahead, Enron thrived, its core trading operations bloomed and it emerged as perhaps the most important company in the energy industry before suddenly collapsing into bankruptcy.","abstract":"Collapse of Enron Corp may deal setback to energy deregulation, which Enron lobbied for more aggressively than any of its competitors; deregulation of power industry has progressed far more slowly than Enron's vaunted influence would suggest, and one of its goals, open access to nation's transmission lines, remains stalled in many regions; questions about Enron's input on Bush administration's energy plan is also drawing Senate scrutiny; former federal regulators, lobbyists and executives of Enron's erstwhile competitors argue that Enron scandal was result not of deregulation, but of lax oversight, hubris and ambition; photos; map (L)","print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Who Will Needle Regulators Now That Enron's Muzzled?"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"BUSH, GEORGE W"},{"name":"glocations","value":"UNITED STATES"},{"name":"organizations","value":"ENRON CORP"},{"name":"subject","value":"ENERGY AND POWER"},{"name":"subject","value":"FINANCES"},{"name":"subject","value":"LAW AND LEGISLATION"},{"name":"subject","value":"ELECTRIC LIGHT AND POWER"},{"name":"subject","value":"LOBBYING AND LOBBYISTS"},{"name":"subject","value":"REGULATION AND DEREGULATION OF INDUSTRY"},{"name":"subject","value":"BANKRUPTCIES"}],"pub_date":"2002-01-20T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Money and Business\/Financial Desk","section_name":"Business","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Neela","rank":1,"lastname":"BANERJEE"}],"original":"By NEELA BANERJEE"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd26be28eb7c8105d824717","word_count":1728,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2002\/01\/19\/opinion\/l-enron-s-employees-214167.html","snippet":"To the Editor:    Re ''Enron Avoided Income Taxes in 4 of 5 Years'' (front page, Jan. 17):    Reports that Enron paid a total of $17 million in taxes over the last five years, while being eligible for $382 million in tax refunds, raise what must b...","lead_paragraph":"To the Editor: Re ''Enron Avoided Income Taxes in 4 of 5 Years'' (front page, Jan. 17): Reports that Enron paid a total of $17 million in taxes over the last five years, while being eligible for $382 million in tax refunds, raise what must be some troubling issues for the Bush administration.","abstract":"Francois Furstenberg letter says reports that Enron paid total of $17 million in taxes over last five years, while being eligible for $382 million in tax refunds, raise questions for Bush administration about federal government's subsidization of wealthiest companies (S)","print_page":"18","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Enron's Employees"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"FURSTENBERG, FRANCOIS"},{"name":"persons","value":"BUSH, GEORGE W"},{"name":"organizations","value":"ENRON CORP"},{"name":"subject","value":"TAX CREDITS"},{"name":"subject","value":"TAXATION"},{"name":"subject","value":"CORPORATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"BANKRUPTCIES"}],"pub_date":"2002-01-19T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Editorial Desk","section_name":"Opinion","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Letter","_id":"4fd22aad8eb7c8105d7b588f","word_count":84,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2002\/01\/19\/opinion\/the-united-states-of-enron.html","snippet":"''Wasn't that the best?'' said a laughing Ann Richards this week, when I asked her reaction to President Bush's effort to hide behind her skirt when questioned about Enron.

''It was so silly. Why didn't he just say Ken Lay was a strong supporter and gave him a half-million dollars and is a good friend, and he's really sorry Ken's in these terrible circumstances?'' Good question. As the world knows now, George W. Bush told two lies when first asked about his ties to the top guy in what may prove the largest corporate flimflam in history. The president said (1) that he only ''got to know'' Mr. Lay in 1994, when in fact their relationship goes back at least to 1992; and (2) that Mr. Lay ''was a supporter'' of Governor Richards, when in fact Mr. Lay told TV's ''Frontline'' last year that he ''did support'' Mr. Bush over Ms. Richards in their Texas race.","abstract":"Frank Rich Op-Ed column on Pres Bush's 'lies' about his ties to Enron chief Kenneth Lay, and how bankrupt company's 'oily fingerprints' are all over Bush administration's actions, as well as its resumes and stock portfolios (M)","print_page":"19","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"The United States of Enron"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"BUSH, GEORGE W"},{"name":"persons","value":"LAY, KENNETH L"},{"name":"organizations","value":"ENRON CORP"},{"name":"subject","value":"FRAUDS AND SWINDLING"},{"name":"subject","value":"UNITED STATES POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT"},{"name":"subject","value":"ETHICS"},{"name":"subject","value":"LOBBYING AND LOBBYISTS"},{"name":"subject","value":"BANKRUPTCIES"}],"pub_date":"2002-01-19T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Editorial Desk","section_name":"Opinion","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Frank","rank":1,"lastname":"RICH"}],"original":"By FRANK RICH"},"type_of_material":"Op-Ed","_id":"4fd25bb28eb7c8105d808e13","word_count":1422,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2002\/01\/18\/business\/enron-s-collapse-executive-seeks-to-sell-property.html","snippet":"The chairman of the Enron Corporation, Kenneth L.
