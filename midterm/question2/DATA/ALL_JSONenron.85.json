On Feb. 4, The Houston Chronicle featured a front-page article headlined ''Houston Will Always Bounce Back,'' which contained what have become familiar lines of comfort. (I've written and thought them myself.) These included reminders about how we built a great city on a malarial swamp, about our penchant for risk-taking, our reflexive optimism and, as one city councilman put it, our refusal to ''dwell on history.'' That same day, Channel 13, the homiest of local newscasts, ran a special segment at 6 p.m. about ''The Enduring Spirit of the Bayou City,'' which included a nod to what they called Houston's ''risk-taker spirit.'' Viewers were reminded that we rise to all challenges. The broadcast then went on, helpfully, to remind us exactly what some of those challenges have been: the 1980's oil bust, the destructive floodwaters of Tropical Storm Allison in 2001, the collapse of Enron and, finally, the Columbia. ''That's what Houstonians do,'' the commentator said after noting our ''recovery'' from such events.
