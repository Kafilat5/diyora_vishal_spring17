Revered and respected throughout the world, we will be forever grateful for his generosity, for the works he gave so enthusiastically to our Foundation, and for his commitment to FAPE's mission. From a sketch on a paper napkin came the design of two magnificent wall sculptures for the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, which greet more than 2,000 Chinese visa applicants daily, employing the colors in our two countries' flags to honor the relationship between the U.S. and China. In Berlin, Ellsworth watched as the 40- foot-high 'Berlin Totem' he created for the U.S. Embassy soared through the air to be placed in its courtyard garden. His extraordinary lithograph, 'Leaves,' adorns the walls of 50 U.S. embassies; and he contributed to our Collection at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations, as well as our millennium Gift To The Nation. He also donated the actual award that we present annually to the recipient of the Leonore and Walter Annenberg Award for Diplomacy through the Arts; the first honoree was Justice Stephen Breyer, who collaborated with Ellsworth on his site- specific installation at the John Joseph Moakley Courthouse in Boston. Ellsworth's last gift to FAPE was the establishment of an endowment, entitled the Ellsworth Kelly Fund for Preservation, to ensure FAPE's Collection is maintained in perpetuity at no cost to the government. Words cannot express how important Ellsworth was to FAPE. His gifts are a testament to his creativity, his genius and his extraordinary spirit. He will always remain in our memory, and his work will remind us of his belief in the importance of art as a means of freedom of expression and cross-cultural understanding.

Following his successful career in business and journalism, Gil became a celebrated scholar of Gustav Mahler, establishing the Kaplan Foundation and conducting Mahler's Second Symphony with leading orchestras around the world. Gil was invited by the Vienna Philharmonic to conduct the original version of Mahler's Second Symphony and his recordings of the Symphony with the London Symphony Orchestra and the Vienna Philharmonic were very successful. Gil demonstrated his deep love and knowledge of music every season as a frequent concertgoer, and many members of the Carnegie Hall's family were honored to be guests on Gil's acclaimed radio program ""Mad About Music."" We will always remember Gil for his warmth, musical scholarship, and his love of Carnegie Hall.

The Board of Trustees and staff of Carnegie Hall mourn the passing of our dear friend and colleague Gilbert Kaplan, passionate music lover and devoted and beloved husband of Lena. Gil joined the Carnegie Hall Board of Trustees in 1980, and served the Hall with devotion for more than thirty-five years. Gil brought his financial acumen and keen insight to Carnegie Hall's management as a longstanding member of the Finance and Operations Committee, where he helped govern major institutional advances from the restoration of Carnegie Hall to the creation of an education center. Following his successful career in business and journalism, Gil became a celebrated scholar of Gustav Mahler, establishing the Kaplan Foundation and conducting Mahler's Second Symphony with leading orchestras around the world. Gil was invited by the Vienna Philharmonic to conduct the original version of Mahler's Second Symphony and his recordings of the Symphony with the London Symphony Orchestra and the Vienna Philharmonic were very successful. Gil demonstrated his deep love and knowledge of music every season as a frequent concertgoer, and many members of the Carnegie Hall's family were honored to be guests on Gil's acclaimed radio program ""Mad About Music."" We will always remember Gil for his warmth, musical scholarship, and his love of Carnegie Hall. We express our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Lena; his devoted children Kristina, Claude, John, and Emily; and their families and loved ones. Sanford I.

Nicholas James Tryforos, son of James and Garufa, was the youngest and last survivor of thirteen children. In explaining why ""Mama and Papa had thirteen children, not twelve or fourteen"" Nick said, ""When I was born, papa picked me up, checked me out, and said 'Mama! FINALLY a perfect baby.'"" A lifelong New Yorker, he was a proud graduate of The Greek American Institute, Theodore Roosevelt High School and New York University. He served in the Army in WWII. After basic training, the Army sent him to language school to become a Hindustani interpreter. He received horse cavalry and military intelligence training, and then served in the Philippines and in General MacArthur's headquarters in Tokyo during the occupation of Japan. Nick used his Hindustani skills for the rest of his life to surprise and delight both friends and complete strangers from India. After returning from Japan Nick worked for 15 years in the family flower and novelty business, then had a 25-year career with the IRS, retiring in 1986 as a Group Manager, supervising large corporation tax audits. Amateur gymnast, superb photographer, family documenter and archivist, Nick was the favorite uncle of many and worked hard to make and cultivate relationships with family and friends. He collected any piece of junk that could potentially serve a future purpose, taught his children the value of a dollar and the importance of grunt labor, and was the original tiger mom and DIY guy. He was the resident teaser (while being wheeled to major surgery with four children at home, Nick whispered to his wife ""don't worry dear, as long as we have our health!"") and an inveterate joke teller (""Have you heard the one about the skeleton that walked into a bar...""). Nick delighted in meeting his children's friends, showing them photos related (and unrelated!) to their discussion, and always enjoyed giving them another tour of the garage! Nick was quietly proud of everyone in his family, and his family was very fortunate to have him. He leaves behind his dear wife of 63 years and best friend Mary, and his children, Margaret and her husband Paul, Jim and his wife Sue, Tom, and Tina and her husband David. He also leaves his grandchildren, Peter, Evan, Kate and her husband Pat, John, Lucas, Eva, and Eli, and great-grandson Theo.

Luncheon Friday, January 8th, after the service, Short Hills Club, 144 Highland Avenue. James C. Kellogg, philanthropist and loving husband, father of three children, and grandfather of nine grandchildren, died on Thursday of congestive heart failure, surrounded by his family. He was 76 years old. Jim was a graduate of The Pingry School, Princeton University, and Harvard Law School. During his career, he was a partner at the Manhattan law firm Townley & Updike, the President of the Community Foundation of New Jersey, the President of the J.C. Kellogg Foundation, and a valued trustee of many non-profit boards. He was most proud of his philanthropic work in Elizabeth, New Jersey. He cherished the idea of creating opportunities for people from disadvantaged backgrounds to be healthy, learn, and grow. Jim grew up in Elizabeth, NJ and spent his summers in Bay Head, NJ, where he made many friends whom he kept throughout his life. Those friends would gather on a regular basis for couples' dinners and bridge marathons. He looked forward to Romeo lunches, Scorpions bridge, and the Literatti book club, where he always touted the latest political book. In the past few years, Jim became a Life Master at bridge by participating in ACBL bridge tournaments across the country. He spent his winters at Yeamans Hall in South Carolina. Jim had a deep commitment to public service; he advised and served on the boards of Frost Valley YMCA, Bay Head Chapel, Short Hills Community Congregational Church, Point Pleasant Hospital, the Children's Specialized Hospital, Trinitas Regional Medical Center, Meridian Health Systems, Council of Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton University, Union County College, Bloomfield College, the Prudential Insurance Company, New Jersey State in the Trust for Public Lands, and the Scholarship Fund for Inner City Children. He was appointed by the Governor to the boards of New Jersey Transit and the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency. His lifelong passion for philanthropy paled in comparison to his love for his family- his wife, three children, and nine grandchildren. Jim was happiest at family gatherings and loved playing backgammon and gin rummy with his children and grandchildren. Pop Pop's signature backgammon move was to wait for his opponent to admit defeat only to turn the board around and play the losing side, teaching his mentee how to stage a comeback and win! He was active in every aspect of his children's and grandchildren's lives, including attending their school events, and offering advice on and help with work issues. He is survived by his wife, Gail Chambers Kellogg, his children, Jimmy Kellogg, Kate Kellogg, and Elizabeth Kellogg Winterbottom; adoring grandchildren, Emily, Jimmy and Grace Kellogg; Chris and Andrew Kellogg Peeler; Hailey, Francesca, Maile, and Penelope Winterbottom; and his three younger brothers, Peter, Kelly, and Rusty.

The Board of Trustees and staff of Carnegie Hall celebrate the life of our dear friend and colleague Pierre Boulez, one of the most important and influential artists of the 20th century. A legendary composer, conductor, musical philosopher and activist, Pierre Boulez was a visionary and trailblazing global force for modern music. Carnegie Hall was privileged to elect him an Honorary Trustee in 1995, and to appoint him as the Richard and Barbara Debs Composer's Chair from 1999 to 2003. Boulez made approximately 75 appearances at Carnegie Hall, conducting close to 60 performances on our stages, and his works have been performed on more than 80 programs. As an arts educator, he was inspirational-challenging audiences to explore a new aesthetic of music through his musical research center IRCAM, and, in the course of the Professional Training Workshops he led through Carnegie Hall's Weill Music Institute, offering profound insights to young musicians. Boulez's work in Paris served as an inspiration in the conception of Zankel Hall, the opening season of which included performances by Boulez with the Ensemble Intercontemporain. Pierre Boulez will be deeply missed by all of us at Carnegie Hall and by the entire artistic community, though his brilliant musical legacy and pioneering spirit will stay with us all.

An uncommon man in every respect, he founded Institutional Investor magazine at the age of 26, serving as its Publisher and Editor-in-Chief for the next two decades, only to embark on a second life as a renowned amateur conductor of Mahler's Second Symphony. He said of the symphony that it ""wrapped itself around me and never let go."" This passion ultimately led to conducting engagements with over 60 orchestras throughout the world, acclaimed recordings of the work with the London Symphony Orchestra and the Vienna Philharmonic and, more recently, a faculty position at Juilliard.

In 1992 he celebrated the Philharmonic's 150th anniversary in a concert also led by former Music Directors Zubin Mehta and Kurt Masur. In the same year Boulez was made an Honorary Member of the Society, an honor shared by such figures as Wagner, Stravinsky, and Bernstein. New York Philharmonic Music Director Alan Gilbert said: ""Pierre Boulez was a towering and influential musical figure whose Philharmonic leadership implicitly laid down a challenge of innovation and invention that continues to inspire us to this day.

Born in Bellevue, Ohio during the Depression, the son of a grocer, he became a page in the U.S. Senate in 1944 and then won scholarships to Philips Academy, Andover and Harvard, an institution he didn't leave until retirement. He graduated magna cum laude with highest honors in 1954, received his Ph.D. in 1960, and was made Professor of English and Comparative Literature in 1969. From 1988 to 2002 he served as Director of Villa I Tatti, the Harvard University Center for Italian Renaissance Studies in Florence. His leadership profoundly shaped I Tatti, and those were among his happiest years; he always felt that he truly belonged to the northern Mediterranean, especially to Greece and Italy. His love of learning and the arts gave color and depth to every aspect of his life. Few people have been more learned or more cultivated, wittier or more awake to beauty. Fewer still have had his genius for friendship. He was extraordinarily generous with his attention, and always finding opportunities for generosity where others wouldn't have seen them. He was the best of fathers. He is survived by his children, Miranda and David, and three granddaughters; by his brother, Bob; by his many godchildren; and by hundreds of others whose lives he enriched immeasurably, as the astonishing outpouring of grief and love from around the world since his death attests. Contributions in his memory may be made to the Walter Kaiser Fund for the Biblioteca Berenson at Villa I Tatti, Harvard University. 1/3"

Carnegie Hall was privileged to elect him an Honorary Trustee in 1995, and to appoint him as the Richard and Barbara Debs Composer's Chair from 1999 to 2003. Boulez made approximately 75 appearances at Carnegie Hall, conducting close to 60 performances on our stages, and his works have been performed on more than 80 programs. As an arts educator, he was inspirational-challenging audiences to explore a new aesthetic of music through his musical research center IRCAM, and, in the course of the Professional Training Workshops he led through Carnegie Hall's Weill Music Institute, offering profound insights to young musicians. Boulez's work in Paris served as an inspiration in the conception of Zankel Hall, the opening season of which included performances by Boulez with the Ensemble Intercontemporain.

As Chief Judge, Judith created the Adoption Now program, helped establish the Center for Court Innovation and co-chaired the ABA Commission on the American Jury. She retired from the bench in 2008, having served longer than any Chief Judge in state history. At Skadden, Judith helped numerous clients navigate complex issues of New York law. She also served as a trustee of the Skadden Fellowship Foundation and continued her advocacy for families and children, including through her service as the chairwoman of the Permanent Judicial Commission on Justice for Children. Judith graduated from Barnard College ('58) and NYU School of Law ('62), where she was one of 10 women in a class of nearly 300.

A brilliant, creative, and abundantly loved giant has left us. Dr. Daniel H. Present, born April 3, 1934, passed away on January 12th from complication of Parkinson's Disease. He was 81 years old. His passing will be deeply mourned by Jane Werner Present, his wife, partner, lover and best friend of more than 59 years, his three children, their spouses, and four grandchildren, Tracy Present, Stephanie, Michael, Billy and Katherine Podalak, Douglas, Susan, Adam and Margot Present, and his sister Judy Present Liss; his friends, associates and the thousands of lives he touched during his 50 years of practice. Dan graduated from Syracuse University Magna Cum Laude, Phi Beta Kappa in 1955 and State University of New York Downstate College of Medicine, Magna Cum Laude, in 1959. He completed an internship, medical residency, Gastroenterology residency and GI Fellowship at Mt. Sinai Hospital, and entered private practice in 1964, where he quickly began to focus his attention on the management of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. He was the recipient of the first research award given by the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America. Dan brought clinical trials into clinical practice. His first paper was accepted for publication in 1966. He subsequently published 329 papers. At the time of his retirement, his publications had been cited more than 15,000 times. During his 54 years at Mt. Sinai, he served as President of both the Association of the Attending Staff and the Alumni Association for which he received the coveted Jacobi Medallion for Conspicuous Service to the Alumni. Dan received every award in his field including the Samuel Bronfman Department of Medicine Distinguished Service Award, The American Gastroenterology Association Distinguished Clinician Award, Master of the American College of Gastroenterology, The WiIIiam Dock, M.D. Master Teacher Award in Medicine State University of New York, the Janssen Award for Outstanding Achievement Award in Clinical Gastroenterology, the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America Lifetime Achievement Award and the George Arents Award for Excellence in Medicine, the highest achievement awarded by Syracuse University. He is generally recognized as having pioneered the way Crohn's disease is treated. More than any recognition, Dan loved taking care of his patients. He loved them and they returned that love many times over. His joy came from sparing his patients the pain, discomfort, and humiliation of inflammatory bowel disease by finding the right combination of medications and thoughtful creativity. He fought against surgery if there was a possible medical solution. He talked with his patients for many more hours than any HMO wouId have allowed. He sat at their bedside and visited them late at night, he celebrated when they felt better. Nothing made him happier than a college student being able to return to school, or a young adult feeling well enough to plan a wedding or bear a child. He loved teaching young Gastroenterologists and, along with a grateful patient, created the Present-Levison fourth year fellowship in Clinical GI, which allowed the brightest young men and women to spend a post-graduate year learning clinical GI at Mt. Sinai. These fellows now care for IBD patients all over the world. Funeral services will be held on Thursday at 12pm at ""The Riverside,"" 180 West 76th St., New York.

Of Vero Beach, FL and Darien, CT, died after a short illness in his Florida home on January 9, 2016 at age 90. He is survived by his wife of 60 years, Joanne Kelly Hagopian; his daughter Susan Goddard and sons Thomas and Matthew; nine grandchildren; his sister Helen Geovjian; and more than 40 members of his extended family. Lou thought himself to be one of the luckiest men in the world, with a wife and family who loved him and whom he loved dearly, parents he respected and adored and a career he both enjoyed and succeeded in beyond his wildest hopes. As the son of parents who fled to the United States after their families were killed in the Armenian Genocide, he felt that he truly lived the American Dream and loved this country for it. Lou served in the US Navy during World War II and graduated from Michigan State University after the War. His career started in the auto business, but his skills in marketing and communications soon led him to a successful career in advertising with the oldest agency in the US, NW Ayer. He led NW Ayer for over 25 years, including the last ten as Chairman and CEO. During his tenure, Ayer was selected Agency of the Year and developed numerous iconic advertising campaigns with taglines such as ""A Diamond is Forever"" and ""Be All That You Can Be."" He also was Chairman of the Advertising Association of America and a founding member of the innovative Partnership for Drug-Free America. Lou was a man of style with an enormous heart, tremendous charm and a wicked wit. He loved to serenade his wife, Joanne, with ""Misty"" or ""My Funny Valentine"" whenever given the slightest excuse (and often without). An avid and excellent golfer for over 70 years, he started as a caddy at the Pine Lake Country Club outside of Detroit and ended as a member of the Royal & Ancient Golf Club in St. Andrews (where he won the Seniors Tournament at the age of 86). Services will be held at St. Thomas More Catholic Church in Darien, CT at 10:30am on Saturday, January 16. A memorial service will also be scheduled for friends and relatives in Vero Beach in the next several weeks. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that a memorial donation be made to Indian River Habitat for Humanity, www.irchabitat.org.

He served in the U.S. Army during World War II, then graduated from New York University (1948), Phi Beta Kappa, and entered the graduate program at Harvard (Ph.D. in English Language and Literature, 1954), where he wrote a prize-winning essay on Shakespeare. He spent his entire teaching career at Tufts University (1954-84), serving twice as chair of the Department of English. He published a number of essays in scholarly journals, a popular introduction to Shakespeare, and he served as General Editor of The Signet Classic Shakespeare, a paperback series (one play per volume) that is widely used in colleges and universities. He was also the author or co-author of several widely used textbooks-on argument (with Hugo Bedau, late of the Tufts Department of Philosophy), art, composition, drama, and literature, including ""A Short Guide to Writing about Art"" (now in its 11th edition), and ""Introduction to Literature"" (16th edition). In 1963, he and William Burto (his partner since 1952, deceased 2013) developed an interest in Japanese art, especially calligraphy, and they went on to build a collection that was exhibited in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Freer Gallery, the Harvard Art Museum, and the Museum of Fine Art, Houston. The Metropolitan exhibition was accompanied by a catalog by Miyeko Murase, ""The Written Image"" (2002), to which Barnet and Burto contributed two essays, one on collecting, the other on looking at calligraphy from a Western point of view. (After Burto's death their collection was divided among the first four of these museums.) He and Burto also wrote ""Zen Ink Paintings"" (1982) as well as several essays on Japanese art. As a teacher of English literature, he was familiar with a good deal of writing about death. Among the favorite passages he carried in his head-he could not understand why some educators disparage ""rote memory""-were Shakespeare's ""Golden lads and girls all must/As chimney sweepers come to dust."" and this epitaph by Sir Henry Wotton (1568-1639), ""Upon the Death of Sir Albert Morton's Wife"": ""He first deceased; she for a little tried/To live without him, liked it not, and died."" (Barnet said, shortly after the death of his partner, that Wotton's lines came to his mind every day, and that he regretted, every day, his inability to re-enact them.) He leaves his sister-in-law Saretta Barnet, a niece and three nephews and their spouses, nine grandnephews and nieces, a great-grandnephew and niece, and his longtime friend, Morton Berman. Most of his estate was bequeathed to a scholarship fund at Tufts, in honor of his parents, Philip and Esther Barnet. By his wish there will be no services. 1/3"

Present, M.D., a beloved physician who, in a five-decade career at Mount Sinai, was at the forefront of research into the diagnosis and treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Dr. Present was the first researcher to show the effectiveness of an immunosuppressant, 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), in fighting Crohn's disease. When Dr. Present published his results in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) in 1980, it changed the lives of thousands of Crohn's patients. Later, he studied the use of cyclosporine for severe steroid- refractory ulcerative colitis, and demonstrated that it could help avoid or delay colectomies in many of these seriously ill patients. In a third breakthrough in the late 1990s, Dr. Present studied cA2, also known as infliximab, an anti-tumor necrosis factor antibody, and showed, in another seminal paper in the NEJM, that it could help close fistulas in Crohn's patients. Early in his career at Mount Sinai, he was mentored by Henry D. Janowitz, M.D., for whom the Division of Gastroenterology is named. Dr. Present was also a talented clinician who cared for thousands of patients over his career. Over a decade ago, he and his wife, Jane, established an endowed fellowship at Mount Sinai to train graduates from outside institutions to become experts in the care of patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Dr. and Mrs. Present also maintained a foundation for clinical research of IBD. Upon his retirement from Mount Sinai in 2014, the foundation donated its principal in support of The Susan and Leonard Feinstein Inflammatory Bowel Disease Clinical Center at Mount Sinai. We extend our deepest sympathies to Jane and their children, Douglas, Stephanie, and Tracy, at this difficult time. Peter W. May, Chairman, Boards of Trustees, Mount Sinai Health System Kenneth L.

He served in the U.S. Army during World War II, then graduated from New York University (1948), Phi Beta Kappa, and entered the graduate program at Harvard (Ph.D. in English Language and Literature, 1954), where he wrote a prize-winning essay on Shakespeare. He spent his entire teaching career at Tufts University (1954-84), serving twice as chair of the Department of English. He published a number of essays in scholarly journals, a popular introduction to Shakespeare, and he served as General Editor of The Signet Classic Shakespeare, a paperback series (one play per volume) that is widely used in colleges and universities. He was also the author or co-author of several widely used textbooks-on argument (with Hugo Bedau, late of the Tufts Department of Philosophy), art, composition, drama, and literature, including ""A Short Guide to Writing about Art"" (now in its 11th edition), and ""Introduction to Literature"" (16th edition). In 1963, he and William Burto (his partner since 1952, deceased 2013) developed an interest in Japanese art, especially calligraphy, and they went on to build a collection that was exhibited in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Freer Gallery, the Harvard Art Museum, and the Museum of Fine Art, Houston. The Metropolitan exhibition was accompanied by a catalog by Miyeko Murase, ""The Written Image"" (2002), to which Barnet and Burto contributed two essays, one on collecting, the other on looking at calligraphy from a Western point of view. (After Burto's death their collection was divided among the first four of these museums.) He and Burto also wrote ""Zen Ink Paintings"" (1982) as well as several essays on Japanese art. As a teacher of English literature, he was familiar with a good deal of writing about death. Among the favorite passages he carried in his head-he could not understand why some educators disparage ""rote memory""-were Shakespeare's ""Golden lads and girls all must/As chimney sweepers come to dust."" and this epitaph by Sir Henry Wotton (1568-1639), ""Upon the Death of Sir Albert Morton's Wife"": ""He first deceased; she for a little tried/To live without him, liked it not, and died."" (Barnet said, shortly after the death of his partner, that Wotton's lines came to his mind every day, and that he regretted, every day, his inability to re-enact them.) He leaves his sister-in-law Saretta Barnet, a niece and three nephews and their spouses, nine grandnephews and nieces, a great-grandnephew and niece, and his longtime friend, Morton Berman. Most of his estate was bequeathed to a scholarship fund at Tufts, in honor of his parents, Philip and Esther Barnet. By his wish there will be no services. 1/3"

A brilliant, creative, and abundantly loved giant has left us. Dr. Daniel H. Present, born April 3, 1934, passed away on January 12th from complication of Parkinson's Disease. He was 81 years old. His passing will be deeply mourned by Jane Werner Present, his wife, partner, lover and best friend of more than 59 years, his three children, their spouses, and four grandchildren, Tracy Present, Stephanie, Michael, Billy and Katherine Podalak, Douglas, Susan, Adam and Margot Present, and his sister Judy Present Liss; his friends, associates and the thousands of lives he touched during his 50 years of practice. Dan graduated from Syracuse University Magna Cum Laude, Phi Beta Kappa in 1955 and State University of New York Downstate College of Medicine, Magna Cum Laude, in 1959. He completed an internship, medical residency, Gastroenterology residency and GI Fellowship at Mt. Sinai Hospital, and entered private practice in 1964, where he quickly began to focus his attention on the management of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. He was the recipient of the first research award given by the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America. Dan brought clinical trials into clinical practice. His first paper was accepted for publication in 1966. He subsequently published 329 papers. At the time of his retirement, his publications had been cited more than 15,000 times. During his 54 years at Mt. Sinai, he served as President of both the Association of the Attending Staff and the Alumni Association for which he received the coveted Jacobi Medallion for Conspicuous Service to the Alumni. Dan received every award in his field including the Samuel Bronfman Department of Medicine Distinguished Service Award, The American Gastroenterology Association Distinguished Clinician Award, Master of the American College of Gastroenterology, The WiIIiam Dock, M.D. Master Teacher Award in Medicine State University of New York, the Janssen Award for Outstanding Achievement Award in Clinical Gastroenterology, the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America Lifetime Achievement Award and the George Arents Award for Excellence in Medicine, the highest achievement awarded by Syracuse University. He is generally recognized as having pioneered the way Crohn's disease is treated. More than any recognition, Dan loved taking care of his patients. He loved them and they returned that love many times over. His joy came from sparing his patients the pain, discomfort, and humiliation of inflammatory bowel disease by finding the right combination of medications and thoughtful creativity. He fought against surgery if there was a possible medical solution. He talked with his patients for many more hours than any HMO wouId have allowed. He sat at their bedside and visited them late at night, he celebrated when they felt better. Nothing made him happier than a college student being able to return to school, or a young adult feeling well enough to plan a wedding or bear a child. He loved teaching young Gastroenterologists and, along with a grateful patient, created the Present-Levison fourth year fellowship in Clinical GI, which allowed the brightest young men and women to spend a post-graduate year learning clinical GI at Mt. Sinai. These fellows now care for IBD patients all over the world. Funeral services will be held on Thursday at 12pm at ""The Riverside,"" 180 West 76th St., New York.

Mary's life was most remarkable for the effect she had on the people around her. She brought light and laughter to every room she entered. A rock of comfort and support for anyone grieving or feeling lonely, Mary loved to laugh and make others laugh, play games, cook, and spend time with friends. She loved her dogs, the mountains, music, boating, reading, and traveling. But most of all, she loved her husband, John, her son, Ike, and her daughter, Lindsey. For those fortunate enough to have met her, Mary will be remembered as one of the warmest and most thoughtful people the world has known. Generous and welcoming, she opened her home to everyone-friends and strangers alike-who needed a home-cooked meal or a safe haven. She was fiercely loyal to and supportive of those close to her and kind to everyone she met. Mary's family takes comfort in the knowledge that her legacy lives on through the immeasurable impact she had on others. While the joy and laughter that her memories evoke pale in comparison to her radiant physical presence, they ensure that she will never be forgotten. It is Mary's family's hope that all who knew her will honor her memory by striving to treat others with the grace and kindness that she did. It was the size of Mary's heart that made the world a better place. A celebration of Mary's life will be held at 5pm on Saturday, January 23, at Baltimore Country Club at Five Farms, 11500 Mays Chapel Road, Lutherville, MD 21093. All friends are welcome. In lieu of flowers, please consider a donation in Mary's name to Dyslexia Tutoring Program (dyslexiatutoringprogram.org). As John Irving, one of Mary's favorite authors, once wrote: ""It is hard work and great art to make life not so serious."" In that respect, Mary was a tireless and masterful artist. 1/3"

President of Alfred Music, passed away at his Los Angeles home on January 9 after a battle with cancer. He was a devoted husband to his wife Iris, a loving father and grandfather, an innovative music publisher, a celebrated author, an inspiring mentor to his staff, and a dedicated friend. Morty was a great man. Born in 1926 in New York to Russian immigrants Samuel and Ann, Morty proudly enlisted in the Air Force during WWII, received a business degree from The City College of New York, and in the late 1940s, joined his father in the family business, Alfred Music. When Morty started working at Alfred Music, there were four employees: Morty's father Sam, a picker, a packer, and a bookkeeper. The important part of this story is Rose, the bookkeeper, who had a daughter named Iris. Morty and Iris fell in love, and as they say, the rest is history. They were married over 60 years. Alfred Music began in New York's Tin Pan Alley in 1922 and focused on mood music for silent films. Inspired by the need for quality music education products, Morty, a pianist, clarinetist, and guitarist, reinvented the company in the 1950s. He oversaw the development of an instructional series for accordion, followed by similar publications for guitar, piano, and recorder. Morty is the author and editor of hundreds of titles in Alfred Music's catalog, including the enormously popular series, Alfred's Basic Guitar Method and Alfred's Basic Piano Library. When Alfred Music outgrew its New York headquarters in the mid-1970s, Morty and Iris moved the company to Los Angeles. As time went by, they split their time between New York and Los Angeles, having many close friends on both coasts. The company continued to grow under Morty's leadership. Morty was joined in the business by his son Ron in 1988 and his son Steven in 1992. The family business expanded into the world's leading instructional music publisher with offices in Australia, Germany, Singapore, and the United Kingdom. In 2005, Alfred Music purchased Warner Bros. Print Publications. Morty received an honorary Doctorate of Music from VanderCook College of Music in July of 2008. Morty and Iris continued to be deeply committed to music education by supporting many music scholarships, competitions, and organizations. Morty had many hobbies including being an avid sports fan, rooting for the Lakers and Dodgers. He was also a keen investor, skilled at stock charting and analysis. Among Morty's other great accomplishments was climbing Mount Washington, New Hampshire on several occasions. He would often remark to his companions during the climb, ""You will tell your grandchildren about this."" Though terribly saddened by their loss, the Manus family members are now focusing on celebrating his life and the bright light of his legacy. Thanks to his amazing life's work, generations of music makers will continue to experience the joy of making music. Morty and Iris recently summed up their love for music education and Alfred Music with these words: ""Working a lifetime with Music and Musicians was not always milk and honey, but it was as close to heaven on earth as we could get."" Morty is survived by his wife Iris; his three sons Steven (wife Sylvie), Scott, and Ron (partner Renee); his three granddaughters Alexandra, Samantha, and Melissandra; and his brother-in-law Jay Kopelman (wife Sherry).

Beloved mother, teacher and friend, passed away peacefully on January 6, 2016, after a long illness. She was at home, surrounded by her three daughters.

In the 1970's as a divorced mother of three, she entered Ramapo College, earned her bachelor's degree and then began her long, rewarding career in education. She taught drama, public speaking, English and literature at Emerson High School for 27 years, helping generations of students to find meaning in stories, to make sense of the world and to find their own voices. Beloved by her students, she was voted favorite teacher by more than a dozen senior classes. Over the years, she shared her love of travel and all things Italian with students she led on trips to Italy. She took joy in the rich process of education and was a lifelong learner herself. From the most recent archeological discovery to finding a new jazz standard; from cooking a favorite meal to alerting the family to a special moonrise, her curiosity and enthusiasm was a joy for all around her. She will be remembered for her laugh, her love of life and her fierce courage of the heart.

Mary's life was most remarkable for the effect she had on the people around her. She brought light and laughter to every room she entered. A rock of comfort and support for anyone grieving or feeling lonely, Mary loved to laugh and make others laugh, play games, cook, and spend time with friends. She loved her dogs, the mountains, music, boating, reading, and traveling. But most of all, she loved her husband, John, her son, Ike, and her daughter, Lindsey. For those fortunate enough to have met her, Mary will be remembered as one of the warmest and most thoughtful people the world has known. Generous and welcoming, she opened her home to everyone-friends and strangers alike-who needed a home-cooked meal or a safe haven. She was fiercely loyal to and supportive of those close to her and kind to everyone she met. Mary's family takes comfort in the knowledge that her legacy lives on through the immeasurable impact she had on others. While the joy and laughter that her memories evoke pale in comparison to her radiant physical presence, they ensure that she will never be forgotten. It is Mary's family's hope that all who knew her will honor her memory by striving to treat others with the grace and kindness that she did. It was the size of Mary's heart that made the world a better place. A celebration of Mary's life will be held at 5pm on Saturday, January 23, at Baltimore Country Club at Five Farms, 11500 Mays Chapel Road, Lutherville, MD 21093. All friends are welcome.

As John Irving, one of Mary's favorite authors, once wrote: ""It is hard work and great art to make life not so serious."" In that respect, Mary was a tireless and masterful artist. 1/3"

March 2, 1924 - January 15, 2016. Constance Lieber transformed her family's experience with significant mental illness into a life suffused with meaning, purpose, and extraordinary effectiveness. Few people could imagine the breadth and depth of her interests, ranging from the most creative modern art to inspiring architecture, exhilarating music, and insightful studies of neuroscience and human behavior. Guided by her compassion, dedication, and curiosity - as well as her personal relationships with scores of leading psychiatrists and neuroscientists - Constance informally advised thousands of parents who were desperately seeking better treatments and cures for their mentally ill children. During their sixty-five year marriage, Constance and her husband Stephen A. Lieber shared enduring love and intense intellectual insights to transform the field of basic and clinical research into the origins of schizophrenia and other mental illnesses. Since 1980, Constance and Steve have been among the leading public advocates and philanthropic supporters of schizophrenia and depression research in the US and around the globe. Their efforts included the creation of significant clinical and scientific institutions to support emerging discoveries in the fields of biological psychiatry and patient services. For over twenty-five years, they gave exemplary leadership to the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation (formerly NARSAD), the world's largest private funder of mental health research. Constance served as President from 1989 to 2007. In 2014, their activities were honored by the American Psychiatric Association with a Special Presidential Commendation, stating ""Constance and Steve have provided unwavering moral and material support to unravel the mysteries of the brain, and to better understand and treat mental illness."" In 1987, the Liebers established an annual award for outstanding achievements in schizophrenia research. To date, two Lieber Prize winners have gone on to win Nobel Prizes. At Columbia University, they founded two centers of excellence - the Lieber Recovery and Rehabilitation Clinic for Psychotic Disorders and the Lieber Schizophrenic Clinic. At Williams College, they were the founders of the undergraduate neuroscience program. In 2011, they created the Lieber Institute for Brain Development, affiliated with the Johns Hopkins University, to integrate new discoveries in developmental neurobiology and genetics in order to achieve clinical advances that can change lives. Constance was a graduate of Brooklyn College and attended Columbia University for her post-graduate studies. She received honorary doctorates from Williams College and Brooklyn College. She received over two dozen awards to recognize her outstanding leadership, including: the Brooke Astor Award for Outstanding Contribution to the Advancement of Science, the Women in Science Award from The Rockefeller University, the Distinguished Service Award from the Yale University's Department of Psychiatry, and the Humanitarian Award from the Society of Biological Psychiatry. Survivors include her beloved husband Stephen, her children Janice and Sam (Mary Rubin), her devoted grandson, her sister Beverly, and several nieces and nephews. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made in her honor to the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation, 90 Park Avenue, 16th Floor, New York, New York 10016. A service will be held at Larchmont Temple, 75 Larchmont Avenue, on Tuesday, January 19th at 11:30am. Burial will be private.

A brilliant, creative, and abundantly loved giant has left us. Dr. Daniel H. Present, born April 3, 1934, passed away on January 12th from complication of Parkinson's Disease. He was 81 years old. His passing will be deeply mourned by Jane Werner Present, his wife, partner, lover and best friend of more than 59 years, his three children, their spouses, and four grandchildren, Tracy Present, Stephanie, Michael, Billy and Katherine Podalak, Douglas, Susan, Adam and Margot Present, and his sister Judy Present Liss; his friends, associates and the thousands of lives he touched during his 50 years of practice. Dan graduated from Syracuse University Magna Cum Laude, Phi Beta Kappa in 1955 and State University of New York Downstate College of Medicine, Magna Cum Laude, in 1959. He completed an internship, medical residency, Gastroenterology residency and GI Fellowship at Mt. Sinai Hospital, and entered private practice in 1964, where he quickly began to focus his attention on the management of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. He was the recipient of the first research award given by the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America. Dan brought clinical trials into clinical practice. His first paper was accepted for publication in 1966. He subsequently published 329 papers. At the time of his retirement, his publications had been cited more than 15,000 times. During his 54 years at Mt. Sinai, he served as President of both the Association of the Attending Staff and the Alumni Association for which he received the coveted Jacobi Medallion for Conspicuous Service to the Alumni. Dan received every award in his field including the Samuel Bronfman Department of Medicine Distinguished Service Award, The American Gastroenterology Association Distinguished Clinician Award, Master of the American College of Gastroenterology, The WiIIiam Dock, M.D. Master Teacher Award in Medicine State University of New York, the Janssen Award for Outstanding Achievement Award in Clinical Gastroenterology, the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America Lifetime Achievement Award and the George Arents Award for Excellence in Medicine, the highest achievement awarded by Syracuse University. He is generally recognized as having pioneered the way Crohn's disease is treated. More than any recognition, Dan loved taking care of his patients. He loved them and they returned that love many times over. His joy came from sparing his patients the pain, discomfort, and humiliation of inflammatory bowel disease by finding the right combination of medications and thoughtful creativity. He fought against surgery if there was a possible medical solution. He talked with his patients for many more hours than any HMO wouId have allowed. He sat at their bedside and visited them late at night, he celebrated when they felt better. Nothing made him happier than a college student being able to return to school, or a young adult feeling well enough to plan a wedding or bear a child. He loved teaching young Gastroenterologists and, along with a grateful patient, created the Present-Levison fourth year fellowship in Clinical GI, which allowed the brightest young men and women to spend a post-graduate year learning clinical GI at Mt. Sinai. These fellows now care for IBD patients all over the world. Contributions in Dan's memory may be made to the Present-Levison Fellowship at Mt.

As she said: ""This is our dream, to find out what causes these disorders, and we felt it had to be a concerted effort, to study the brain and how it develops, and this is what the Institute is all about."" The world of behavioral and developmental neuroscience has lost one of its strongest advocates and supporters. Connie is always in our hearts and minds. In honor of her passion and commitment, we will work tirelessly to achieve the mission she empowered us to pursue. 1/3"

March 2, 1924 - January 15, 2016. Constance Lieber transformed her family's experience with significant mental illness into a life suffused with meaning, purpose, and extraordinary effectiveness. Few people could imagine the breadth and depth of her interests, ranging from the most creative modern art to inspiring architecture, exhilarating music, and insightful studies of neuroscience and human behavior. Guided by her compassion, dedication, and curiosity - as well as her personal relationships with scores of leading psychiatrists and neuroscientists - Constance informally advised thousands of parents who were desperately seeking better treatments and cures for their mentally ill children. During their sixty-five year marriage, Constance and her husband Stephen A. Lieber shared enduring love and intense intellectual insights to transform the field of basic and clinical research into the origins of schizophrenia and other mental illnesses. Since 1980, Constance and Steve have been among the leading public advocates and philanthropic supporters of schizophrenia and depression research in the US and around the globe. Their efforts included the creation of significant clinical and scientific institutions to support emerging discoveries in the fields of biological psychiatry and patient services. For over twenty-five years, they gave exemplary leadership to the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation (formerly NARSAD), the world's largest private funder of mental health research. Constance served as President from 1989 to 2007. In 2014, their activities were honored by the American Psychiatric Association with a Special Presidential Commendation, stating ""Constance and Steve have provided unwavering moral and material support to unravel the mysteries of the brain, and to better understand and treat mental illness."" In 1987, the Liebers established an annual award for outstanding achievements in schizophrenia research. To date, two Lieber Prize winners have gone on to win Nobel Prizes. At Columbia University, they founded two centers of excellence - the Lieber Recovery and Rehabilitation Clinic for Psychotic Disorders and the Lieber Schizophrenic Clinic. At Williams College, they were the founders of the undergraduate neuroscience program. In 2011, they created the Lieber Institute for Brain Development, affiliated with the Johns Hopkins University, to integrate new discoveries in developmental neurobiology and genetics in order to achieve clinical advances that can change lives. Constance was a graduate of Brooklyn College and attended Columbia University for her post-graduate studies. She received honorary doctorates from Williams College and Brooklyn College. She received over two dozen awards to recognize her outstanding leadership, including: the Brooke Astor Award for Outstanding Contribution to the Advancement of Science, the Women in Science Award from The Rockefeller University, the Distinguished Service Award from the Yale University's Department of Psychiatry, and the Humanitarian Award from the Society of Biological Psychiatry. Survivors include her beloved husband Stephen, her children Janice and Sam (Mary Rubin), her devoted grandson, her sister Beverly, and several nieces and nephews.

Our father Herbert C. Bernard passed away at home on January 16, 2016. He was 103 years old. He loved New York City. As the owner of a manufacturing business, he had clients throughout the City and watched neighborhoods change. He remembered horse drawn carriages filled the street and veterans of the Civil War parading in their uniforms on Memorial Day. His father survived the 1918 influenza and his uncle was gassed in World War I. Dad received an excellent public school education and graduated with highest honors from his high school while working for the Brooklyn Eagle covering sports. He entered Columbia in 1928 but to his great regret, had to leave to contribute to the support of his family. He made up for this perceived shortcoming by visiting libraries and museums. He became a connoisseur of drawings and paintings with a small collection. His deep commitment to the City was expressed in community service. Our father was the longest serving trustee of Congregation Emanu-El; he chaired many of its committees and he and our mother endowed its museum of Judaica. They were both actively involved in a number of charitable organizations. For Dad it included Montefiore Medical Center and UJA-Federation. He also was particularly proud of his service to his industry. For many years he was a board member of the Paperboard Packaging Council and served a term as its non-executive President.

He remembered horse drawn carriages filled the street and veterans of the Civil War parading in their uniforms on Memorial Day. His father survived the 1918 influenza and his uncle was gassed in World War I. Dad received an excellent public school education and graduated with highest honors from his high school while working for the Brooklyn Eagle covering sports. He entered Columbia in 1928 but to his great regret, had to leave to contribute to the support of his family. He made up for this perceived shortcoming by visiting libraries and museums. He became a connoisseur of drawings and paintings with a small collection. His deep commitment to the City was expressed in community service. Our father was the longest serving trustee of Congregation Emanu-El; he chaired many of its committees and he and our mother endowed its museum of Judaica. They were both actively involved in a number of charitable organizations. For Dad it included Montefiore Medical Center and UJA-Federation. He also was particularly proud of his service to his industry. For many years he was a board member of the Paperboard Packaging Council and served a term as its non-executive President.

Justice Garibaldi was born November 26, 1934, in Jersey City to Dr. Louis and Marie S. Garibaldi. As an only child, she lived most of her life in Hudson County. The Garibaldis raised their daughter with a strong belief in equal opportunity for women and encouraged her to pursue a nontraditional career path. She was a pioneer and role model to so many. She is survived by loving cousins, adoring godchildren and many cherished friends and colleagues. As a child, Justice Garibaldi attended Stevens Hoboken Academy through 12th grade. She graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree with honors in economics and a political science minor from Connecticut College (New London, CT) in 1956. With an intent to follow in her grandfather's footsteps and attend business school, Justice Garibaldi learned first-hand women weren't accepted. Instead, she enrolled in Columbia Law School as a pathway into the business world and graduated in 1959. In 1963, Justice Garibaldi earned her Master of Laws degree in tax law from New York University School of Law. She was a member of the New Jersey, New York, and District of Columbia Bars and the first woman to serve as president of the New Jersey State Bar Association. Justice Garibaldi began her legal career with the New York Regional Counsel in the Internal Revenue Service. She received extensive trial experience in Tax Court. The Hatch Act restricted government employees from political speech-making and article-writing which ultimately caused Justice Garibaldi to make her next career move. She briefly worked at a firm now known as Riker, Danzig, Scherer, Hyland & Perretti (Riker, Danzig)-within three years she was made a partner which was virtually unheard of at that time. While at Riker, Danzig, Justice Garibaldi also served as a municipal court judge in Weehawken, NJ, from 1973 to 1975, writing the majority of opinion in several cases affecting women. Justice Garibaldi was introduced to Republican Thomas H. Kean by a Riker, Danzig partner. This ultimately led Justice Garibaldi to serve as co-chair of his gubernatorial campaign. Once elected, Governor Thomas H. Kean nominated Justice Garibaldi to the New Jersey Supreme Court. In 1982, Justice Garibaldi became the first woman appointed to the New Jersey Supreme Court- she served as Associate Justice of New Jersey's highest court until she retired in 2000. She authored more than 225 opinions while on the Supreme Court and was known for her advocacy of complementary dispute resolution. She chaired the Supreme Court's committee on that subject, and in 1998, the American Inns of Court Foundation established the Justice Marie L. Garibaldi American Inn of Court for Alternative Dispute Resolution. Justice Garibaldi was the recipient of many awards, including the Medal of Excellence from the Columbia University School of Law. She received honorary degrees from St. John's University Law School, Seton Hall University Law School, Fairleigh Dickinson University, Drew University, Upsala College, St. Peter's College, Caldwell College, and the College of Saint Elizabeth. Justice Garibaldi joined the Hackensack University Medical Center in 2001 and served as vice chair of Hackensack University Medical Center's Board of Governors. She also served on the Hackensack University Health Network's Board of Trustees, as chair of the Executive Compensation Committee and on the Hackensack University Medical Center Foundation's Board of Trustees. She chaired the Hudson Riverfront Performing Arts Center and served as a member of the Board of Directors of the National Italian American Foundation. Justice Garibaldi also served as a director of Crown Holdings, Inc. from 2000 to 2007. She also served as a member of the New Jersey Council on Local Mandates. In addition, Justice Garibaldi served as the secretary of the American Association Order of Malta, USA and executive vice president of the American Society of the Italian Legions of Merit. She also served as a director of the State Chamber of Commerce, New Jersey Bell Telephone Co., and the Washington Savings Bank. She also was a trustee of St. Peter's College. Justice Garibaldi truly enjoyed traveling, reading mysteries, and dinner and dancing with friends. She will be greatly missed by friends, loved ones and colleagues. Justice Marie L. Garibaldi was predeceased by her parents-her father, Dr. Louis Garibaldi passed away in 1975 and her mother, Marie S. Garibaldi passed away in 2013 at the age of 103. The funeral will be on Thursday, January 21 at 9am from the Leber Funeral Home in Union City then to St. Augustine Church where, at 10am, a Mass will be offered. Visitation will be on Tuesday, January 19 from 7 to 9pm, Wednesday, January 20 from 2 to 5pm and 7 to 9pm.

Their support and eventual leadership made BBRF the major source of private funding for research on mental illness. In addition to psychiatric research, the Liebers generously supported other programs at Columbia University over a 20-year period; their philanthropy benefited the training of M.D. and Ph.D. students, established the Lieber Center for Schizophrenia Research, and funded the Lieber Clinic for Recovery from Mental Illness. In 2014, Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons honored the Liebers with the Crown Award. The entire Columbia community extends its deepest condolences to the Lieber Family.

(1925-2016). Manhattan School of Music and its Board of Trustees are profoundly saddened by the passing of Alan M. Ades, a successful entrepreneur and deeply committed philanthropist who was a great friend to MSM and an influential force for progress at the School. A Trustee Emeritus who served as a member of the School's Board of Trustees for 21 years between 1990 and 2011, Mr. Ades, along with his wife Joan Taub Ades, made many profound contributions to MSM over the years, ensuring the School's advancement as one of the world's leading independent music conservatories. In addition to his important service as a member of MSM's Board, Mr. Ades' stewardship was reflected in his active commitment to the many MSM committees of which he was a member and by the generous leadership contributions he and Mrs. Ades made to the School, often by way of the Joan and Alan Ades-Taub Family Foundation. Many of Mr. Ades' most significant contributions to MSM were guided by his love of opera (he also served as a director at the Met Opera and Santa Fe Opera). In addition to providing generous support to MSM scholarships for classical vocalists, the Ades Family Foundation established and continues to fund the School's prestigious Alan M. and Joan Taub Ades Vocal Competition, an annual event that is judged by an esteemed panel of opera professionals and awards significant cash prizes to winning students. Perhaps most significant, Mr. and Mrs. Ades led the capital campaign for, and ultimately named, one of MSM's key performance and rehearsal spaces, an indispensable, flexible black-box space that not only accommodates full-scale opera and orchestral rehearsals, but also seats audiences of up to 200 for a wide variety of performances. This key addition to MSM's facility-the Alan M. and Joan Taub Ades Performance Space-opened its doors in 2007 and stands as a lively testament to the visionary leadership and generosity made to MSM by this prominent leader in business and philanthropy and his wife, Joan Taub Ades. Our Board of Trustees, Administration, Faculty, Alumni, and Current Students are united in expressing the MSM Community's sorrow at the passing of this singular individual. We extend our heartfelt condolences to Mrs. Ades, whose continuing friendship we so highly cherish, and to the Ades family; we know that Alan's long, rich, accomplished life and the many wonderful memories it inspires will be a source of comfort and joy in the days and years ahead.

Awarded her Doctorate of Hebrew Literature at age 66, Dr. Zielenziger was instrumental in creating the curriculum for teaching the books of Genesis and Exodus in Conservative Judaism at the Melton Research Center of the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York City. The Melton program emphasized critical inquiry and the study of Bible for character education. She was a proponent of studying the creation myths and texts of other Middle Eastern cultures in order to better understand the context in which the Bible was written. Born in London, the daughter of Leo and Lola Herrmann, ardent Zionists, she grew up in Jerusalem before the founding of the Jewish state, and served as an ambulance driver and chauffeur in the British Army during World War II, where her fluency in Hebrew, English and German was invaluable. After the War, she attended the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, where she met a German emigre and fellow student, Yehuda Pfeuffer, whom she renamed Yehuda Amichai. Amichai went on to become Israel's most celebrated poet, and the first drafts of many of his most enduring poems were composed as letters exchanged between the two. Amichai's letters to Dr. Zielenziger are now archived at Ben Gurion University in Israel. She moved to New York in 1947, to study at the Teachers Institute of the Seminary. While in New York she met and subsequently married Eric W. Zielenziger, a German Jewish survivor of the Holocaust who escaped the Nazis by living underground in Amsterdam for more than two years. They had two children. For 34 years, Dr. Zielenziger taught education at the Jewish Theological Seminary, after teaching for many years in Hebrew schools in Brooklyn, Queens and Long Island. Before relocating to Riverdale in their later years the Zielenzigers lived primarily in Freeport and Great Neck, NY. She is survived by her sons David, of Great Neck, and Michael (Diane Abt) of Oakland, CA and Manhattan and a brother, Dr. Gabriel Herrmann of Jerusalem.

Robert Dayton, whose career spanned decades in support of a vibrant downtown Minneapolis, MN, died on January 17th. He was 73 years old. A great-grandson of the founder of Daytons, Bob carried on the family retail and community-oriented legacy. After graduating from Yale in 1964, Bob joined what was to become Dayton Hudson and then Target, rising to become General Merchandise Manager and then Vice President of Stores. While with Daytons, Bob attended the Program for Management Development at Harvard Business School. A merchandiser at heart, Bob became recognized for his deftness in identifying and supporting designers such as Calvin Klein and Ralph Lauren early in their careers. In 1977 Bob left Daytons and purchased Harold, an upscale specialty store for women. Working together with his wife Joanie, Bob restored its iconic status as a Minneapolis retail institution. In 1984 Bob spearheaded the development of The Conservatory, the first enclosed shopping complex in Minneapolis. Throughout his career Bob advocated for a thriving downtown and worked to strengthen the Twin Cities as a major league community through efforts to bring Superbowl XXVI to Minneapolis, keep the Timberwolves, and secure funding for a new outdoor Twins stadium. Bob served on several corporate boards including Northwestern National Bank, First American Funds, and Williams Sonoma. In 1992 Bob became CEO of Okabena, helping transform the Dayton family office into a nationally recognized leader in the then-nascent family office industry. Fiercely loyal to and enormously proud of the people and places he loved, Bob was committed to serving his community. He worked tirelessly on behalf of many non-profits including the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, Abbott Northwestern Hospital, the United Way, and Westminster Presbyterian Church. In addition, Bob served as a Trustee of the Blake School, Carlton College, and the University of Minnesota Foundation. In 1994 Bob founded and was later named Chair Emeritus of the Mentoring Partnership of Minnesota. Bob grew up in Wayzata, Minnesota and attended Blake, Eaglebrook, and Taft. While at Yale, Bob met his wife Joanie, then attending Skidmore College, on a blind date at the Dartmouth Winter Carnival. They were married in 1964 and had three boys. Bob enjoyed a number of hobbies, but none more so than golf. Beginning at Woodhill Country Club, his passion eventually extended east to Pine Valley and west to Cypress Point. He cofounded Spring Hill Golf Club and enjoyed playing in the U.S. Seniors. Bob will always be remembered for his warm heart, wonderful smile, infectious laughter, fantastic sense of humor, and tremendous spirit. He is survived by Joanie, his wife of 51 years, two brothers, three sons, and seven grandchildren. A memorial service will be held on February 18th at Westminster Presbyterian Church in Minneapolis. 1/3"

Jack was born in New York City, December 24, 1945, later preferring to tell folks he grew up on a small island off the coast of New Jersey. He studied at Stephens Institute of Technology and later earned his BS degree at Long Island University. Taking pre-med courses, he planned to follow in the footsteps of his deceased father, who was a NYC physician. All that changed when he took a summer job at Thomas J. Lipton company where he discovered the many faceted world of food science. His enthusiasm for food science never diminished. During his 20 year corporate career, he worked at a number of leading food companies including Best Food and Chesebrough Ponds. He gained experienced in every aspect of food processing, plant production, food safety, product development and federal filing regulations and practices. He was a trained taster who could recognize the individual spices in any combination presented, much to the surprise of restaurant chefs, a number of whom he advised and befriended over the years. As his career evolved, his focus centered on canned foods and he became one of New York's foremost food processing authorities. As such, he was a consultant who was recognized and worked with the United States Department of Agriculture and food processing. An avid sailor and scuba diver since his teens, Jack left the corporate world behind to sail from New York City to the Caribbean with a sailor buddy, exploring practically every island there during their six month cruise. Soon after his return, he formed his own company, Van Ness Food Technologies, which he operated while living aboard his 37 foot sailboat, ""Cruzin,"" docked at City Island, NY. In 1992, he found ""the love he had been waiting for"" when he met Carolyn, another enthusiastic scuba diver. They married in 2001 aboard a yacht in New York harbor. Throughout their years together, they traveled the world, lured by possible dive adventures in the Caribbean, Bora Bora, Europe, Mexico and the Red Sea. One of Jack's favorite sea stories was about his transatlantic sail aboard a 42 foot sailboat from Bermuda to Malaga, Spain. ""Sailing across the Pond is on every sailor's bucket list and I couldn't be happier or more satisfied because I got to do it,"" said Jack. Jack loved being with friends and sharing sea stories based on his experiences sailing with Carolyn up and down Long Island Sound, always on the lookout for a new raft up spot and seafood restaurant. For almost 30 years, Jack's consulting business worked with international clients in Canada, Greece, Israel and Korea. He was a featured lecturer at the First Food Safety Conference held in Bangalore, India, where he taught Indian food scientists how to implement Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point safety principles. Jack was a hands on expert who knew how to build and manage a food plant from its conception to the time the canned food product was on the pallet ready to go to market. He was known for his strong sense of integrity and absolute dedication to ensuring the safety of any food product under his production management. He was a charter member of IFTPS, participating in annual food conferences in the US and abroad. Jack was more than generous in passing along his wealth of knowledge to his many clients, interspersed with updates about his latest sailing or diving adventures. His genuine enjoyment of life was contagious. It enabled Jack to engage in lively conversations and make friends with young and old alike. With the wind at his back, he has charted his course, leaving us with memories of an unforgettable personality, sharp wit, brilliant mind and smile. Besides his beloved wife, Carolyn, he leaves behind a worldwide group of business associates and longtime friends, whose many lives he touched. At his request, his ashes are to be scattered over the area waters that gave him so much pleasure. There will be a celebration of Jack's life during the coming sailing season. 1/3"
2016-01-24,"Paid Notice: Deaths  WASHINGTON, BRYAN R.",The New York Times,article,http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980DEEDB1F3AF937A15752C0A9609D8B63,Classified,Paid Death Notices,"WASHINGTON--Bryan R.,professor of late 19th and 20th century American literature and cultural studies, and a man of considerable wit, humor, style, elegance, and charm, with a passion for the beauty and joy of some of life's most abundant and finest offerings, died of cancer on December 31, 2015. He was 57. The son of Dr. Joseph R. Washington, Jr. and the late Sophia M. Washington, Bryan was born in Boston, Massachusetts. During his formative years, Bryan lived in numerous towns and cities in Wisconsin, Virginia, California, and Pennsylvania, where he attended the University of Pennsylvania. At UPenn, Bryan was a Benjamin Franklin Scholar; he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree (with honors) in General Literature in 1980. UPenn served as a catalyst for Bryan's graduate studies, which led him to complete his Master's Degree in English Literature at Christ Church, Oxford University in 1982 through Penn's Thouron Award, a British-American exchange program. Bryan received his second Master's Degree in English and American Language at Harvard University in 1985. He was also a Minority Prize Fellow from 1982-1987. Bryan received his Ph.D. in English and American Literature and Language from Harvard in 1989. Bryan launched his academic career as an instructor at Lafayette College in 1987 and was promoted to Assistant Professor in 1989. He served as a Ford Foundation Postdoctoral Fellow at Princeton University from 1991-1992. In 1994, Bryan was promoted to Associate Professor with full tenure. Bryan's scholarly work includes the publication of a book entitled ""The Politics of Exile: The Ideology in Henry James, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and James Baldwin"" in 1995. The book was well received and widely cited. It is considered by many to be one of the first works to position James Baldwin alongside white canonical American authors. Bryan also authored several articles and reviews, including: ""Paris Blues(s),"" an essay on James Baldwin; and ""WASP Mischief: Martha Stewart and the Racial Status Quo."" He was in the process of writing two books before he became ill. Throughout his career at Lafayette, which spanned over a quarter century, Bryan received numerous honors, including the Student Government Superior Teaching Award in 1989-1990 and 1992-1993, which is rare for a professor to receive twice. Bryan delivered presentations at Lafayette on topics such as ""Blacks in Popular Culture"" and ""Black Writers in the Classroom."" In May 2014, Bryan delivered ""The Last Lecture"" to graduating seniors; this was, sadly, Bryan's last lecture and last professional engagement. The title of the lecture was: ""In the Course of It All: Life is Words;"" this honor, along with the two student government teaching awards, suggests how deeply he was loved by his students- his courses were always over-enrolled. Students described him as inspiring, exciting, funny, and extremely smart. Bryan once described his teaching in the following terms: ""If asked what I aim to accomplish in the classroom, I would say I am trying for a good conversation. For in all my courses dialogue is a primary emphasis. I enjoy lecturing, but my class presentations, generally, are designed to provoke dissuasion. Whether just beginning college work or about to finish, undergraduates (I believe) have something to teach me."" As a resident of Doylestown, PA, Bryan's life included jazz and the American songbook as a joy, metaphor and interpretation of his many passions: writing, literary criticism, food, art, ""beautiful things,"" and, of course, Paris. During evenings, he would often play his stereo or the piano and sing to Carmen McRae, Shirley Horn or other great jazz artists, while duck was in the oven (or some other scrumptious dish) along with a plate of pate and wine at the ready, all for the evening's feast to be shared with Russell Clinton, his husband and life partner for 23 years, and, on many occasions, close friends. During his stay fighting cancer in various hospitals and healthcare facilities, Bryan often said that the rooms that he was in were ""simply awful"", and ""he wants to go out in style"" - of course his care and room assignments were, in fact, top notch! But, we all know Bryan and his desire to be surrounded by beauty. So, what did he do to dress up his room(s)? He buys a beautifully designed Simon Pearce lamp for only a brief stay. And, at Christmas, even though he was unable to eat solid foods or drink, he had a bounty of epicurean delights delivered from Dean and Deluca for him to taste and smell, including his favorite wines and brandy, all for the decadence of it all, and to celebrate his favorite holiday in abundance with his dear Russell. In addition to his husband Russell, Bryan is survived by his father, Joseph; father and mother-in-law, Bill and Ruthann; brother, David, and his partner, Christine; Russell's sister, Debbie and her children Calvin, Travis and Kiara and numerous other family members and friends. A celebration of Bryan's life will be held at 4pm, Friday, January 29, 2016 at Buckingham Friends School, 5684 York Road, Lahaska, PA. In lieu of flowers, memorial contributions may be made to the Abramson Cancer Center of the University of Pennsylvania Annual Fund, Penn Medicine Development, 3535 Market Street, Suite 750, Philadelphia, PA 19104 or online at https://www.cancer. pennmedicine.org.

A merchandiser at heart, Bob became recognized for his deftness in identifying and supporting designers such as Calvin Klein and Ralph Lauren early in their careers.

In 1984 Bob spearheaded the development of The Conservatory, the first enclosed shopping complex in Minneapolis. Throughout his career Bob advocated for a thriving downtown and worked to strengthen the Twin Cities as a major league community through efforts to bring Superbowl XXVI to Minneapolis, keep the Timberwolves, and secure funding for a new outdoor Twins stadium. Bob served on several corporate boards including Northwestern National Bank, First American Funds, and Williams Sonoma.

Because he was saved by a Christian family, George never forgot that his life was spared by Christians and just last year, he created a foundation to rescue thousands of persecuted Christians in the Middle East. This man never forgot his debts and always repaid them. As an immigrant during World War II, George became an integral part of the BBC World Service and broadcast reports in several languages. In 1969, Queen Elizabeth acknowledged Britain's appreciation and knighted him, followed by a life peerage in the House of Lords in 1976.

Awarded her Doctorate of Hebrew Literature at age 66, Dr. Zielenziger was instrumental in creating the curriculum for teaching the books of Genesis and Exodus in Conservative Judaism at the Melton Research Center of the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York City. The Melton program emphasized critical inquiry and the study of Bible for character education. She was a proponent of studying the creation myths and texts of other Middle Eastern cultures in order to better understand the context in which the Bible was written. Born in London, the daughter of Leo and Lola Herrmann, ardent Zionists, she grew up in Jerusalem before the founding of the Jewish state, and served as an ambulance driver and chauffeur in the British Army during World War II, where her fluency in Hebrew, English and German was invaluable. After the War, she attended the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, where she met a German emigre and fellow student, Yehuda Pfeuffer, whom she renamed Yehuda Amichai. Amichai went on to become Israel's most celebrated poet, and the first drafts of many of his most enduring poems were composed as letters exchanged between the two. Amichai's letters to Dr. Zielenziger are now archived at Ben Gurion University in Israel. She moved to New York in 1947, to study at the Teachers Institute of the Seminary. While in New York she met and subsequently married Eric W. Zielenziger, a German Jewish survivor of the Holocaust who escaped the Nazis by living underground in Amsterdam for more than two years. They had two children. For 34 years, Dr. Zielenziger taught education at the Jewish Theological Seminary, after teaching for many years in Hebrew schools in Brooklyn, Queens and Long Island. Before relocating to Riverdale in their later years the Zielenzigers lived primarily in Freeport and Great Neck, NY. She is survived by her sons David, of Great Neck, and Michael (Diane Abt) of Oakland, CA and Manhattan and a brother, Dr. Gabriel Herrmann of Jerusalem. 1/3"

Over his nearly 60 year career, Ryan also maintained an active private practice, first in New York, and then too in East Hampton. Born in 1930 in Albion, NY, Ryan didn't fit the typical mold of psychotherapist. He rode high school football stardom to Yale, where he started as quarterback in his senior year, and also punter and kick-off receiver. Invited to training camp with the Cleveland Browns, Ryan opted instead for Harvard Medical School, and a life beyond football. In addition to former students, patients, and colleagues, Ryan is survived by his loving family: Wife Lisa Eyer Ryan, daughter Justine Ryan, sons Maxwell and Oliver Ryan, and granddaughter Ursula, as well as by his brother Maury Ryan of Providence, RI. 1/3"

He was 82 years old. After earning a Master of Architecture degree from Yale University, Fredenburgh worked for a quarter century at I.M. Pei & Partners, where he was an associate partner and design principal. He established his own office, Fredenburgh Wegierska-Mutin Architects, in 1990. In his work with the Pei firm and in independent practice, each of his buildings marked its setting with iconic forms and distinctive public spaces, from a master planned waterfront promenade in Dubai to the iconic CenTrust Tower in Miami, Texas Commerce Tower in Houston, and First Interstate World Center, the tallest building west of Chicago, which provides a memorable centerpoint to the vast horizontal landscape of Los Angeles. Harold Fredenburgh also made major contributions to the design of the John Hancock Tower in Boston. Fredenburgh's efforts in landmark preservation and planning policy contributed to shaping New York City. For two decades his leadership in planning and design review in his home community of Bronxville, New York, was instrumental in preserving the unique character of a landmark residential village while allowing it to meet the challenges of contemporary needs. He was a guiding voice on the Scholarship and Brunner Award Committees of the American Institute of Architects/New York Chapter, a member of the Planning and Urban Design Committee, and a founding member of the Society of Architectural Historians. An unusually well read and scholarly architect, he was an accomplished international lecturer on design and urban planning issues, and was widely regarded in both the university and in the office as a dedicated teacher and ardent advocate of young professionals. As a consequence of his experience with the design of tall buildings, in 1998 he was elected one of four American members of the Russian Academy of Architecture and Building Sciences. He was elevated to Fellowship in the American Institute of Architects in 2014. Harold Fredenburgh will be very missed by his daughter Audrey Mateer, son-in-law Robert Williams, Anna Mutin, friends and colleagues. 1/3"

2016-01-26,"Paid Notice: Deaths  KENNEDY, MICHAEL JOHN",The New York Times,article,http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D02E1DA1F3AF935A15752C0A9609D8B63,Classified,Paid Death Notices,"KENNEDY--Michael John, on January 25, 2016 at age 78 of cancer. Civil rights lawyer who fought for the First, Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Amendments. Mr. Kennedy, whose career as both a civil liberties and criminal attorney began in California in the 1960s, successfully defended Black Panther Huey Newton on manslaughter and murder charges in Oakland. In San Francisco, he won acquittal for all seven young Mexican Americans, Los Siete de la Raza, charged with murdering a police officer in the city's Mission District. And when Jimmy Mitchell, co-owner of San Francisco's notorious O'Farrell Theatre-which journalist Hunter S. Thompson called 'The Carnegie Hall of Public Sex'-was accused of killing his brother Artie in a drunken rage, Mr. Kennedy succeeded in having the charge reduced from murder in the second degree to manslaughter. In Illinois he represented Rennie Davis, a member of the Chicago Eight accused of conspiracy and inciting a riot during the 1968 Democratic National Convention and served as Mr. Davis's lawyer before the House Un-American Activities Committee in Washington, D.C. He also represented Bernardine Dohrn who belonged to 1960s radical group, The Weathermen. Other of his clients belonged to the Brotherhood of Eternal Love, the most famous member of which was Timothy Leary, LSD guru to a generation. In Lincoln, Nebraska, Mr. Kennedy won acquittal for a Penobscot Native American charged with assaulting FBI agents at Wounded Knee. Perhaps his most famous trial and certainly the most time consuming-it still remains the longest criminal jury trial in U.S. Federal Court history-was The Pizza Connection; the name came from accusations of drug money laundering through pizza parlors in New York City. When the U.S. Attorney put two warring mafia families on trial, the case played out like a drama between the Capulets and the Montagues with Mr. Kennedy retained as chief council representing one of the godfathers, Sicilian mob boss Gaetano Badalamenti. Wire taps were the basis for charges against six Americans raising money in New York to buy weapons for the IRA in Ireland. As lead council, Mr. Kennedy won an acquittal for all six men. He also won clemency from New York Governor Mario Cuomo for Jean Harris, the private girls' school headmistress who was in prison for the notorious murder of her lover, Scarsdale Diet doctor Herman Tarnower. Mr. Kennedy worked on only one divorce case in his career and although the settlement was sealed, reliable sources reported that Ivana Trump was very pleased. There were many pro-bono cases about which no one has written. And there were many times when people from all walks of life, the high, the low, and the undocumented, sought Kennedy's advice privately and many times he privately reached out to connections, sometimes in the government, sometimes in the underworld. As general council to High Times Magazine for 41 years, Mr. Kennedy and his friend, the magazine's founder, the late Tom Forcade, sought to subvert prohibition of marijuana. When a reporter recently asked Mr. Kennedy how he kept High Times out of trouble for so long, he replied simply that he had never asked or allowed them to do anything illegal but added: ""At High Times we will never forget what was done in the name of law enforcement to our scarred arrestees, and those who still rot in prison for daring to try to enjoy themselves peacefully and harmlessly."" Mr. Kennedy was the consummate gentleman, with a quick Irish wit and a quick Irish temper. But he very rarely raised his voice, being the personification of Theodore Roosevelt's foreign policy: Speak softly but carry a big stick. The romance between Michael Kennedy and Eleanora, his wife of forty-seven years, is the stuff of fairy tales. Marrying after love at first sight, they never spent a night apart and sometimes signed their names as one word. Although not an attorney, Mrs. Kennedy was her husband's most trusted associate and confidant working entirely behind the scenes on every case, becoming an unofficial voir dire expert. The couple eschewed the label 'socialite' but could be seen often at benefits for Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital, the Central Park Conservancy and the United Nations. They gave as many parties as they attended, a number of which were chronicled in New York Magazine and the New York Social Diary. When not working or traveling, Mr. Kennedy spent his time between New York City, his Hamptons home Kilkare, his old Key West cottage in West Palm Beach and his house in Ireland's Black Valley. Michael John Kennedy, who died at Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital, was born in the state of Washington in 1937. After boarding school in Washington, he attended University of California at Berkeley and Hastings Law School. Besides his wife Eleanora, he leaves his daughters Anna Safir and Lisa Kennedy, his son Scott Hamilton Kennedy, three granddaughters and two grandsons. Friends may call at Frank E. Campbell, 1076 Madison Avenue at 81st Street on Wednesday from 2-4 and 6-8pm. The funeral service will be held on Thursday at 10am at the Church of St. Paul the Apostle, 60th Street and Columbus Avenue. 1/3"

On January 25, 2016 at age 78 of cancer. Civil rights lawyer who fought for the First, Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Amendments. Mr. Kennedy, whose career as both a civil liberties and criminal attorney began in California in the 1960s and culminated in 2009 as Special Advisor to the President of the United Nations, Miguel D'Escoto. He successfully defended Black Panther Huey Newton on manslaughter and murder charges in Oakland. In San Francisco, he won acquittal for all seven young Mexican Americans, Los Siete de la Raza, charged with murdering a police officer in the city's Mission District. And when Jimmy Mitchell, co- owner of San Francisco's notorious O'Farrell Theatre- which journalist Hunter S. Thompson called 'The Carnegie Hall of Public Sex'-was accused of killing his brother Artie in a drunken rage, Mr. Kennedy succeeded in having the charge reduced from murder in the second degree to manslaughter. In Illinois he represented Rennie Davis, a member of the Chicago Eight accused of conspiracy and inciting a riot during the 1968 Democratic National Convention and served as Mr. Davis's lawyer before the House Un-American Activities Committee in Washington, D.C. He also represented Bernardine Dohrn who belonged to 1960s radical group, The Weathermen. Other of his clients belonged to the Brotherhood of Eternal Love, the most famous member of which was Timothy Leary, LSD guru to a generation. In Lincoln, Nebraska, Mr. Kennedy won acquittal for a Penobscot Native American charged with assaulting FBI agents at Wounded Knee. Perhaps his most famous trial and certainly the most time consuming-it still remains the longest criminal jury trial in U.S. Federal Court history-was The Pizza Connection; the name came from accusations of drug money laundering through pizza parlors in New York City. When the U.S. Attorney put two warring mafia families on trial, the case played out like a drama between the Capulets and the Montagues with Mr. Kennedy retained as chief council representing one of the godfathers, Sicilian mob boss Gaetano Badalamenti. Wire taps were the basis for charges against six Americans raising money in New York to buy weapons for the IRA in Ireland. As lead council, Mr. Kennedy won an acquittal for all six men. He also won clemency from New York Governor Mario Cuomo for Jean Harris, the private girls' school headmistress who was in prison for the notorious murder of her lover, Scarsdale Diet doctor Herman Tarnower. Mr. Kennedy worked on only one divorce case in his career and although the settlement was sealed, reliable sources reported that Ivana Trump was very pleased. There were many pro-bono cases about which no one has written. And there were many times when people from all walks of life, the high, the low, and the undocumented, sought Kennedy's advice privately and many times he privately reached out to connections, sometimes in the government, sometimes in the underworld. As general council to High Times Magazine for 41 years, Mr. Kennedy and his friend, the magazine's founder, the late Tom Forcade, sought to subvert prohibition of marijuana. When a reporter recently asked Mr. Kennedy how he kept High Times out of trouble for so long, he replied simply that he had never asked or allowed them to do anything illegal but added: ""At High Times we will never forget what was done in the name of law enforcement to our scarred arrestees, and those who still rot in prison for daring to try to enjoy themselves peacefully and harmlessly."" Mr. Kennedy was the consummate gentleman, with a quick Irish wit and a quick Irish temper. But he very rarely raised his voice, being the personification of Theodore Roosevelt's foreign policy: Speak softly but carry a big stick. The romance between Michael Kennedy and Eleanora, his wife of forty-seven years, is the stuff of fairy tales. Marrying after love at first sight, they never spent a night apart and sometimes signed their names as one word. Although not an attorney, Mrs. Kennedy was her husband's most trusted associate and confidant working entirely behind the scenes on every case, becoming an unofficial voir dire expert. The couple eschewed the label 'socialite' but could be seen often at benefits for Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital, the Central Park Conservancy and the United Nations. They gave as many parties as they attended, a number of which were chronicled in New York Magazine and the New York Social Diary. When not working or traveling, Mr. Kennedy spent his time between New York City, his Hamptons home Kilkare, his old Key West cottage in West Palm Beach and his house in Ireland's Black Valley. Michael John Kennedy, who died at Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital, was born in the state of Washington in 1937. After boarding school in Washington, he attended University of California at Berkeley and Hastings Law School. Besides his wife Eleanora, he leaves his daughters Anna Safir and Lisa Kennedy, his son Scott Hamilton Kennedy, three granddaughters and two grandsons. Friends may call at Frank E. Campbell, 1076 Madison Avenue at 81st Street on Wednesday from 2-4 and 6-8pm.

We mourn the loss of Ruth Yorkin Drazen-mother, filmmaker and pioneer in genetics-who died quietly in her sleep on Monday evening at the age of 97. Ruth was born in Washington, PA on May 15, 1918, the daughter of Jesse Sachs Yorkin and Maurice A. Yorkin. Ruth adored classical music from early childhood on, studying piano at the Curtis School of Music with Henry Kaufman. In 1938 she married fellow Curtis student, Mario Berini, and they moved to New York City, where Mario began his career as a tenor with the Met. Their only child, Anton, died in infancy of a rare genetic disease, and Ruth's grief sparked her interest in curing genetic illnesses. She spent years working tirelessly as executive director of The Muscular Dystrophy Association and The National Genetics Foundation. When her second husband, New York attorney Jerome Drazen, died of prostate cancer in 1988, she developed an abiding passion for the subject of humanism in medicine, expressing it through the making of documentary films, which she continued to create into her early nineties. Her first film, ""When Doctors Get Cancer,"" was a sensitive look at doctors treating other doctors, in the hope that it might make more humane the care that physicians gave, when they were able to observe themselves as cancer patients. Five other award-winning films followed, most of them shown on PBS. They included, ""The Choice is Yours,"" the inspirational life of the great psychiatrist, Victor Frankl, ""A Wayfayer's Journey; Listening to Mahler;"" ""Notes From the Edge, the Diary of Peter J. Morgan, M.D.,"" an intimate narrative of the last two years of the life of a 29-year old physician diagnosed with cancer, and ""Healing Through Humanism,"" a five DVD teaching series devoted to the practice of compassionate medicine. Ruth was an intellectual and spiritual inspiration to everyone she touched, and will be sorely missed. Ruth is survived by a son, Myron Drazen and daughter-in-law, Lucille; a sister, Martha Yorkin Berman; two step-sons, Michael and Roger Drazen and seven grandchildren, Julie, Debra, Jacob, Dylan, Emily, Kate and Zoe Drazen. She was predeceased by a son, Anton Berini, as well as brother Alan ""Bud"" Yorkin; husbands Mario Berini and Jerome Drazen.

His stamina was superhuman; he worked long hours and still made himself available round the clock until the day he entered the hospital.

Artist, Designer, Mother and Friend. Hope F. Hudner died at home in Little Compton, RI on January 14, 2016 following a thirteen month battle with glioblastoma multiforme, a form of brain cancer. Hope is survived by her husband of 40 years, Michael, and her daughter, Bay, who were deeply involved as caregivers and comforters during the past year, and were at her side at the time of her peaceful passing. Hope is also survived by her aunt, Judy Freeman N. Gross; brothers, Ambassador Charles ""Chas"" W. Freeman, Jr. (Margaret Carpenter) and Robert P. Freeman (Inge Reist); their five children and nine grandchildren (Hope's grand-nieces and -nephews); siblings-in-law, Mr. Kennedy Hudner (Jennifer), Ms. Cornelia Futterman (Michael), and Ms. Kristina Beitman (Harty), and their five children. Hope was born on January 11, 1951 in Nassau, The Bahamas, and lived there until age 10, then alternating time in Southern California with years in Providence and Bristol, RI. Hope was predeceased by her son, Michael Ripley (""Rip"") Hudner, and her parents (father, Charles Wellman Freeman, and mother, Carla Park Freeman, who died when Hope was 20 months old). Hope was largely raised by her two sets of deceased grandparents, Hovey T. and Marjorie W. Freeman of Providence and Bristol, and George C. and Fentress K. Park of Wollaston, MA and Roaring Brook, MI. Hope graduated from The Lincoln School, Providence (1969), Smith College (1973), and also acquired an MFA from New York University. The family lived in New York City from 1974 through 1994, and then resided in Little Compton and Providence, RI. Hope was an accomplished artist and designer with a portfolio including work in graphic, interior, jewelry, and apparel design. These efforts led to her 2013 creation of Hope Hudner Designs, focused on elegant silk infinity scarves. Hope was deeply involved in Rhode Island public service, including, at various times, board and/or development responsibilities at Moses Brown School, Women & Infants Hospital, Rhode Islanders Sponsoring Education (RISE), RISD Museum, Perennial Planters, The National Society of the Colonial Dames of America (Rhode Island), and Providence Preservation Society. Hope's social involvements included membership in the Providence Art Club, Colony Club of New York City, Lyford Cay Club, Sakonnet Golf Club, and Sakonnet Point Club. Hope had great admiration for the natural world and actively cultivated a sense of wonder: she was a faithful student of plants and flowers (as evidenced by the thousands of bulbs planted across Rhode Island, Maine, and New York); she loved sailing with her family and friends (countless excursions on Narragansett Bay and longer trips to Maine, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, and Ireland number among the most special); and her keen curiosity led her to explore the far corners of the world, from Spain and Taiwan at age 18 to Antarctica at 49, covering every other continent and many countries in between. Hope had enormous energy, deep intelligence, natural grace, and remarkable warmth. She believed that life presented endless opportunity to learn, remarking on the tenth anniversary of her son's death that, ""Each time it rains in our lives, we are given an opportunity for further growth. I am grateful for the challenges in my life as chances to grow and blossom."" Hope faced her illness with the same fortitude and poise. While she was indeed a lifelong learner, Hope was perhaps most notable as a teacher of these invaluable lessons to the rest of us. Hope felt a profound duty to embrace everyone she encountered with love and kindness, and she shared this love of people and life like water from a fire hose. All within range were enriched by her presence and generosity of spirit. Hope inspired people to think lovingly and boldly on behalf of the larger community, themselves, and their friends, prompting many to find more inside themselves to enhance their own lives and those of others. A college classmate of Bay's said it beautifully in a recent note to Hope: ""You feature prominently as an inspiration for the life I want to live-to pursue my interests, to live fully and with panache, to spend time in nature, and, most of all, to be kind to people. I know I am just one of the many, many people you affect in this way!"" A celebration of Hope's life will be held in Little Compton in early June on a date to be announced. In lieu of flowers, the family suggests contributions in Hope's memory be made to: the Rip Hudner Memorial Fund at Moses Brown School, Providence; Dr. Patrick Wen's Research in Neuro-Oncology at Dana Faber Cancer Institute, Boston; or a charity of your choice. Above all, the family encourages you to remember Hope by engaging with the world through love and kindness. 1/3"

From a base in East Anglia during World War II, 19 year old Howard Sloan flew 33 missions over Germany. His B-24 was named ""The Stork Club."" When praised for his bravery, he would invariably respond: ""Was there a choice?"" Cheers erupted from a crowd on the beach when, piloting his plane home to the states after the war, he dipped his wings over the Inwood Country Club. Mr. Sloan was born in New York City on March 20, 1924. He graduated from the Woodmere Academy and Pawling Preparatory School, and received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Yale University, Class of '45W. He and his late wife, Sonny, along with George and Barbara Bush, were the only two married couples on campus. Dreams of business school were dashed by financial necessity and he joined his father's insurance company, Harris, Sloan and Finn. Characteristically, he turned the experience into a colorful one, representing clients such as Restaurant Associates; Richard Burton, who dispatched him to Rome to deliver a diamond he'd bought at auction for Elizabeth Taylor, or Cartier to present a love bracelet to Valentino, who insisted Howard personally fasten it on his wrist. He became an art insurer, developing great interest and knowledge of art in the process, befriending numerous artists and inspiring a lifetime of collecting: Mayan and PreColumbian sculpture, works by artists as diverse as Giacometti and Bill King, Henry Moore and Lindner. He acquired an art gallery, Multiples, for his wife, Sonny, and Marian Goodman to run. In 1990, he was invited by his friend and mentor, Charles Wohlstetter, to become a partner in the latter's acquisitions of hundreds of independent telephone companies from Alaska to California. They formed Continental Telephone, later known as Contel, in 1962. The company then agreed to be acquired by GTE, a combination that created the nation's largest local telephone company. Sloan remained on the Board of GTE until it was restructured as Verizon. In 1968, an American syndicate acquired an 18th century chateau in Bordeaux with Wohlstetter and Sloan installed as new owners. Chateau Bouscaut was the second most beautiful vineyard in Bordeaux, Sloan proclaimed, second, he said, because he didn't want to boast. Among the many American guests who flocked to visit, his favorite was Mary Lindsay, whom he overheard saying to her husband, then mayor of NYC, ""John, if I have to see one more vineyard, I'll kill myself."" To Sloan's eternal regret, Bouscat was sold in 1980. Mayor Lindsay brought Sloan onto the board of the Vivian Beaumont Theatre in 1984. At that time, according to Andre Bishop, current artistic director, ""Nobody would give you a nickel for the Beaumont."" It is now one of the leading theatrical companies in New York, if not the world. Mr. Sloan served on the Board until his death on Thursday. In 1977, Sloan joined the Board of Trustees of the New York Blood Center, of which he was Chairman from 1993 to 2000, nominating his successor, Howard Milstein. In January 2013, a congressional extension prepared by Representative Carolyn Maloney in recognition of Mr. Sloan's 15 years of distinguished service and dedication to NYBC's mission, was entered into the congressional record. She cited his humanitarian status and commended his leadership and tireless advocacy. For several years, he presided as Chairman of Northside Center for Child Development, founded by Kenneth and Mamie Clarke, earning a colleague's recent comment, ""There was a time this place wouldn't have existed without Howard Sloan."" He and his wife are to be honored for their dedication to Northside at a gala in May 2017. Howard Sloan died of kidney failure in Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital on January 21, 2016. Handsome as a film star, he will be remembered for his elegance and extraordinary wit. He is survived by his wife, Barbara; two daughters, Kathryn Roth of Weston, Massachusetts, Gillis Cone of Woodbury, Connecticut; a son, Douglas Sloan, of Palm Beach; a stepdaughter, Paulette Bartlett Robinson, of Los Angeles, and four grandchildren. Interment will be private and a memorial service will take place at Frank E. Campbell Funeral Home on Wednesday, February 10th. 1/3"

After 96 years of laughing, loving, shouting, learning, teaching, and building, Henry, the beloved patriarch of the Kibel family, passed away peacefully Wednesday night surrounded by family and friends. Henry created a wonderful life for his family and for the many others who benefited from his generosity. He graduated from Stuyvesant High School, William & Mary College and Yale University School of Architecture. He was a naval officer in the South Pacific during World War II. Henry was an architect, a builder and an artist. He built thousands of apartments in New York City. Every part of the development process carried his imprint. Henry was a master of making things-creating gave him joy. Whether he was building an apartment tower or creating illustrations that accompany the recipes of the renowned chef Andre Soltner's cookbook, Henry's passion never stopped. In addition to the building legacy he created, Henry was, in his own words, the inventor of important things: the 12"" kitchen cabinet and innovative real estate advertising- including the successful campaign for 85 John Street, 'featuring lousy views and flushing toilets.' The fancy suspender companies will sorely miss Henry, who supported their industry and whose industry supported his pants. Although he oversalted everything, he managed to live to 96. On second thought, his memory was not so great for the last 10 years, so maybe the salt was not so good. Henry is survived by his sister, three children, eight grandchildren, and many nephews and nieces.

NYU Lutheran's board and staff are deeply saddened by the passing of chair emeritus Howard Smith. As chairman of Lutheran Medical Center and Augustana Center from 1966 until 2004, Smith, who died Thursday at age 85, left an indelible legacy on southwest Brooklyn. With his friend New York City Mayor John Lindsay and the American Lutheran Church, Mr. Smith brokered the 1977 expansion and relocation of Lutheran Medical Center from 4th Avenue and 46th Street to its present location, a former warehouse at 55th Street and 2nd Avenue in Sunset Park. He facilitated the creation of the Sunset Park Family Health Center, now called NYU Lutheran Family Health Centers, the second largest federally qualified health center network in the nation. He created a lasting financial foundation for Lutheran through Health Plus, an innovative government-sponsored insurance program for low-income residents. Lutheran's sale of Health Plus to Amerigroup in 2011 created an endowment that continues to help modernize the health system. Mr. Smith, a lifelong Brooklyn resident, was chairman emeritus of the United Hospital Fund, former president of the Brooklyn Public Library Board of Trustees, and past vice president and director of the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce. Mr. Smith received a bachelor's in chemical engineering from Princeton University and served in the U.S. Army. He served 40 years as president of Virginia Dare Extract Company, which was founded by his grandfather Bernard, and was a former director of Dime Savings Bank of New York before it merged with Washington Mutual in 2002. He is predeceased by his wife, Elsie, and survived by his three children, Howard Jr., Jean, and Lilla, and grandchildren. NYU Lutheran mourns as we celebrate Mr. Smith's life and legacy. A wake will be held at Clavin Funeral Home, 7722 4th Ave., Brooklyn, on Tuesday, February 2, at 4-8pm.

After 96 years of laughing, loving, shouting, learning, teaching, and building, Henry, the beloved patriarch of the Kibel family, passed away peacefully Wednesday night surrounded by family and friends. Henry created a wonderful life for his family and for the many others who benefited from his generosity. He graduated from Stuyvesant High School, William & Mary College and Yale University School of Architecture. He was a naval officer in the South Pacific during World War II. Henry was an architect, a builder and an artist. He built thousands of apartments in New York City. Every part of the development process carried his imprint. Henry was a master of making things-creating gave him joy. Whether he was building an apartment tower or creating illustrations that accompany the recipes of the renowned chef Andre Soltner's cookbook, Henry's passion never stopped. In addition to the building legacy he created, Henry was, in his own words, the inventor of important things: the 12"" kitchen cabinet and innovative real estate advertising- including the successful campaign for 85 John Street, 'featuring lousy views and flushing toilets.' The fancy suspender companies will sorely miss Henry, who supported their industry and whose industry supported his pants. Although he oversalted everything, he managed to live to 96. On second thought, his memory was not so great for the last 10 years, so maybe the salt was not so good. Henry is survived by his sister, three children, eight grandchildren, and many nephews and nieces.

Martin L. Gross of New London, NH and Ocean Ridge, FL died on Tuesday, January 26, 2016 in Ushuaia, Argentina following a stroke suffered en route to Antarctica. He was 77 years old. Martin's adventures began in New York City where he was born on October 22, 1938. As a young child, Martin and his older brother, Woolf, were dispatched to summer camps and later to working cattle ranches in Utah during the summer months to escape the polio outbreaks that plagued New York City in the years following World War II. After high school, Martin headed north to Cambridge, MA where he attended both Harvard College and Harvard Law School, graduating from the latter in 1964. Before embarking on his first job as a law clerk in New Hampshire, Martin and his first wife, the late Caroline Lord Gross, purchased a Volkswagen pop-up camper and drove to Alaska with Martin's mother, Harriet. Harriet slept in the camper; Martin and Caroline slept outdoors in a tent. After several weeks of abysmal weather the camper was coated with a thick layer of adobe-colored mud. When the trio returned to Concord and washed the car for the first time, it was in pristine condition. Thereafter, Martin never worried much if his car was dirty. Following his clerkship, Martin joined the Concord, New Hampshire law firm of Sulloway & Hollis, P.L.L.C. from which he retired (while maintaining senior counsel status) in 2015 after more than 50 years of distinguished service to his clients and to the New Hampshire Bar. As with everything else in life, Martin viewed the practice of law as an adventure. He delighted in besting his adversaries and often developed long and lasting friendships with them. His in-house writing boot camps were legendary and his wit and charm were ever present at the office and in the courtroom. While working full-time as a Sulloway lawyer, Martin served three terms as the mayor of Concord. During these years, Martin developed a real talent for cooking. This was driven by necessity since Caroline's busy schedule at the State House meant she was often home late. Undeterred by a complete lack of training (and by a lifelong aversion to cookbooks) Martin channeled his inner top chef and produced thousands of wonderful meals for friends and family. The informal ""Sunday Suppers"" he enjoyed with his close friends Malcolm and Susan McLane, Liz and Dennis Hager and other dear Concord friends were a social staple. Six years after the loss of his beloved Caroline in 1993, fate intervened and Martin met his second wife, Deirdre Sheerr-Gross, architect, New London, NH. The meeting occurred at Chicago's O'Hare Airport where both were waiting to board a flight back to New Hampshire. It would turn out to be a kismet flight on United Airlines (friendly skies indeed!) with Deirdre sitting in seat 2B and Martin (who always flew coach and never paid for upgrades) inexplicably seated in seat 3B directly behind Deirdre. Seeing that seat 2A was open, Martin leaned over and graciously asked Deirdre ""Can I buy you dinner?"" They have been having dinner together ever since. This episode gave Martin plenty of fodder for his expansive repertoire of bad puns....""United"" Airlines.... 2B or not to be.... Martin made the most of it. Six months later, in July 2000, Martin and Deirdre were married. During their 15 year marriage, Martin and Deirdre traveled the world. Despite temporary setbacks (Martin's surgeries, lost luggage, etc.) they visited South America, Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Central America and multiple European countries. This past September, Martin and Deirdre rented an Airstream trailer and toured Grand Teton and Yellowstone parks; they did not have to sleep outdoors. Over the past few years, one of Martin's happiest endeavors was building a warm winter getaway in Ocean Ridge, FL. He loved living in a house designed by his wife, Deirdre. Two weeks ago, Martin and Deirdre left for Antarctica; a trip that was to be Martin's last great adventure. While southbound on his way to Antarctica on a cruise ship he suffered a stroke and had to be transferred to a passing northbound vessel. That ship docked safely in Ushuaia (the cruise's point of origin) where Martin underwent surgery to relieve a subdural hematoma. Despite excellent care and a successful surgery, Martin contracted an infection from which he did not recover. Martin loved the spontaneity and unpredictability of travel. He would have appreciated the irony of his last great adventure. Martin is survived by his wife, Deirdre Sheerr-Gross, of New London, NH; his brother, Woolf Gross (spouse Lucy) of Arlington, VA; a nephew, William Gross, of Arlington, VA; two cousins, John and Charles Gross, both of New York City, and his brother-in-law (affectionately referred to as ""hermano west,"" Hugh McCrystal (spouse Polly). In addition, Martin is survived by dozens of close friends including his childhood friend, Peter Soloman (who Martin always introduced as ""the man I've never not known""), Will and Sherry Rogers and their two daughters, Anne and Catherine (who were Martin's goddaughters and who lovingly called him ""Uncle Martin""), Peter and Jean Burling, Rick and Karla Karash, Alex Bernhart and Myra Mayman, Merwyn and Carol Bagan, and others too numerous to name. In honor of Martin's extraordinary service to his community, donations can be made to the New Hampshire Charitable Foundation (on whose board he served for many years), to the Capitol Center for the Arts, to New Hampshire Public Radio, or to the charity of one's choice. Funeral arrangements and information about a celebration of Martin's life will be announced at a later date. 1/3"

Leader in Academic Pediatrics: Born May 20, 1923, died January 22, 2016. Laurence Finberg, a pediatrician and scientist, was known for his contributions to the management of salt and water balance in children. He served as Chair of Pediatrics at the State University of New York (SUNY) at Downstate in Brooklyn from 1982- 1994, and was Dean of the School of Medicine at SUNY Downstate from 1988-1991. A native of Chicago, Dr. Finberg received an SB (1944) and MD degree (1946) from the University of Chicago. In August, 1950 during a major epidemic of poliomyelitis, when he was the Admitting Officer for Contagious Diseases at Baltimore City Hospitals, he took the bold step of integrating previously segregated medical services by admitting an African American adult to previously all white wards, breaking the color barrier. Dr. Finberg served on the faculty at Johns Hopkins from 1951-1963. He became Chair of Pediatrics at Montefiore Hospital and Professor of Pediatrics at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in 1963. After moving to San Francisco in 1995, he continued to teach Pediatrics, serving on the faculty of both Stanford and UCSF medical schools. Dr. Finberg was beloved by medical students and residents and as teacher and served as a role model for countless young physicians and aspiring physicians. His work led to life-saving treatment for children, especially children from disadvantaged backgrounds all over the world, who have been the victims of dehydration. Dr. Finberg was Chair of the Academy of Pediatrics Committees on Nutrition and Environmental Hazards. An expert in the diagnosis and treatment of lead poisoning in children, he promoted the idea of testing the environment (obtaining lead levels in paint and other areas in the environment), rather than waiting to find high levels in the blood of children. His arguments against ""using children as the canaries in the coal mine,"" changed the emphasis and undoubtedly prevented disease in many children exposed to peeling paint and poor housing conditions. A gentle man, he was incredibly devoted to his friends and family, and will be remembered for his good natured sense of humor that lightened all occasions. In addition to being a devoted husband, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather, he is remembered by his family and friends for his love of chocolate, travel, good wines, and the Chicago Cubs. He is survived by his wife of 20 years, Joann Quane-Finberg, his children Robert W. Finberg, Jeanne Finberg, James M. Finberg, their spouses Joyce, Robert, Melanie, and many loving grandchildren and great-grand children. His first wife, Harriet Levinson Finberg, died in 1994 after 49 years of marriage. 1/3"

During more than 50 years as a physician-scientist, Dr. Cooper had a distinguished and diverse career. He began his clinical and investigative training in hematology and oncology in the 1960s at the National Cancer Institute and Boston City Hospital's Thorndike Laboratory. He later joined the University of Pennsylvania faculty as Chief of Hematology, founded the Abramson Cancer Center, and taught in the Leonard Davis Institute, both at Penn. A native of Milwaukee, Dr. Cooper returned there as dean of the Medical College of Wisconsin in 1985, subsequently founding and directing MCW's Health Policy Institute. Among the first to recognize a potential doctor shortage, Dr. Cooper was a leading authority on the economic and social dynamics underlying healthcare spending and utilization. Increasingly he studied healthcare through the lens of poverty; his book about the effect of income inequality on poor healthcare outcomes will be published by Johns Hopkins University Press later this year.

We mourn the loss of Ruth Yorkin Drazen-mother, filmmaker and pioneer in genetics-who died quietly in her sleep on Monday evening at the age of 97. Ruth was born in Washington, PA on May 15, 1918, the daughter of Jesse Sachs Yorkin and Maurice A. Yorkin. Ruth adored classical music from early childhood on, studying piano at the Curtis School of Music with Henry Kaufman. In 1938 she married fellow Curtis student, Mario Berini, and they moved to New York City, where Mario began his career as a tenor with the Met. Their only child, Anton, died in infancy of a rare genetic disease, and Ruth's grief sparked her interest in curing genetic illnesses. She spent years working tirelessly as executive director of The Muscular Dystrophy Association and The National Genetics Foundation. When her second husband, New York attorney Jerome Drazen, died of prostate cancer in 1988, she developed an abiding passion for the subject of humanism in medicine, expressing it through the making of documentary films, which she continued to create into her early nineties. Her first film, ""When Doctors Get Cancer,"" was a sensitive look at doctors treating other doctors, in the hope that it might make more humane the care that physicians gave, when they were able to observe themselves as cancer patients. Five other award-winning films followed, most of them shown on PBS. They included, ""The Choice is Yours,"" the inspirational life of the great psychiatrist, Victor Frankl, ""A Wayfayer's Journey; Listening to Mahler;"" ""Notes From the Edge, the Diary of Peter J. Morgan, M.D.,"" an intimate narrative of the last two years of the life of a 29-year old physician diagnosed with cancer, and ""Healing Through Humanism,"" a five DVD teaching series devoted to the practice of compassionate medicine. Ruth was an intellectual and spiritual inspiration to everyone she touched, and will be sorely missed. Ruth is survived by a son, Myron Drazen and daughter-in-law, Lucille; a sister, Martha Yorkin Berman; two step-sons, Michael and Roger Drazen and seven grandchildren, Julie, Debra, Jacob, Dylan, Emily, Kate and Zoe Drazen.

Henry was an architect, a builder and an artist. He built thousands of apartments in New York City. Every part of the development process carried his imprint. Henry was a master of making things-creating gave him joy. Whether he was building an apartment tower or creating illustrations that accompany the recipes of the renowned chef Andre Soltner's cookbook, Henry's passion never stopped.

From a base in East Anglia during World War II, 19 year old Howard Sloan flew 33 missions over Germany. His B-24 was named ""The Stork Club."" When praised for his bravery, he would invariably respond: ""Was there a choice?"" Cheers erupted from a crowd on the beach when, piloting his plane home to the states after the war, he dipped his wings over the Inwood Country Club. Mr. Sloan was born in New York City on March 20, 1924. He graduated from the Woodmere Academy and Pawling Preparatory School, and received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Yale University, Class of '45W. He and his late wife, Sonny, along with George and Barbara Bush, were the only two married couples on campus. Dreams of business school were dashed by financial necessity and he joined his father's insurance company, Harris, Sloan and Finn. Characteristically, he turned the experience into a colorful one, representing clients such as Restaurant Associates; Richard Burton, who dispatched him to Rome to deliver a diamond he'd bought at auction for Elizabeth Taylor, or Cartier to present a love bracelet to Valentino, who insisted Howard personally fasten it on his wrist. He became an art insurer, developing great interest and knowledge of art in the process, befriending numerous artists and inspiring a lifetime of collecting: Mayan and PreColumbian sculpture, works by artists as diverse as Giacometti and Bill King, Henry Moore and Lindner. He acquired an art gallery, Multiples, for his wife, Sonny, and Marian Goodman to run. In 1990, he was invited by his friend and mentor, Charles Wohlstetter, to become a partner in the latter's acquisitions of hundreds of independent telephone companies from Alaska to California. They formed Continental Telephone, later known as Contel, in 1962. The company then agreed to be acquired by GTE, a combination that created the nation's largest local telephone company. Sloan remained on the Board of GTE until it was restructured as Verizon. In 1968, an American syndicate acquired an 18th century chateau in Bordeaux with Wohlstetter and Sloan installed as new owners. Chateau Bouscaut was the second most beautiful vineyard in Bordeaux, Sloan proclaimed, second, he said, because he didn't want to boast. Among the many American guests who flocked to visit, his favorite was Mary Lindsay, whom he overheard saying to her husband, then mayor of NYC, ""John, if I have to see one more vineyard, I'll kill myself."" To Sloan's eternal regret, Bouscat was sold in 1980. Mayor Lindsay brought Sloan onto the board of the Vivian Beaumont Theatre in 1984. At that time, according to Andre Bishop, current artistic director, ""Nobody would give you a nickel for the Beaumont."" It is now one of the leading theatrical companies in New York, if not the world. Mr. Sloan served on the Board until his death on Thursday. In 1977, Sloan joined the Board of Trustees of the New York Blood Center, of which he was Chairman from 1993 to 2000, nominating his successor, Howard Milstein. In January 2013, a congressional extension prepared by Representative Carolyn Maloney in recognition of Mr. Sloan's 15 years of distinguished service and dedication to NYBC's mission, was entered into the congressional record. She cited his humanitarian status and commended his leadership and tireless advocacy. For several years, he presided as Chairman of Northside Center for Child Development, founded by Kenneth and Mamie Clarke, earning a colleague's recent comment, ""There was a time this place wouldn't have existed without Howard Sloan."" He and his wife are to be honored for their dedication to Northside at a gala in May 2017. Howard Sloan died of kidney failure in Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital on January 21, 2016. Handsome as a film star, he will be remembered for his elegance and extraordinary wit. He is survived by his wife, Barbara; two daughters, Kathryn Roth of Weston, Massachusetts, Gillis Cone of Woodbury, Connecticut; a son, Douglas Sloan, of Palm Beach; a stepdaughter, Paulette Bartlett Robinson, of Los Angeles, and four grandchildren.

Sol Schwartz, of Sarasota, Florida passed away on December 25, 2015 at the age of 84. Sol was a gifted and prolific artist, the founder of the nationally acclaimed Options college counseling program, a talented musician, a dedicated art teacher and guidance counselor at Sheepshead Bay High School. Sol was the de facto ""artist in residence"" at Tanglewood Music Center in the Berkshires where he created the iconic graphic of Seiji Ozawa now immortalized on Tanglewood's poster. His work has been exhibited at the Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge, MA, at the Massachusetts College of Art in Boston, numerous galleries, and is to be featured in an upcoming show at Wigmore Hall, London. A selection of his art can be viewed at www.solschwartz.com. The son of Ukrainian Jewish immigrants, Sol grew up on Manhattan's Lower East Side. As a child, he lugged wet wash up tenements to his father's laundry's customers. Sol started drawing at five. He entered New York City's High School of Music and Art. By 16 Sol had joined the New York Mandolin Symphony Orchestra. He starred in the play ""Tomorrow the World"" as a teen. At 35 he studied cello and played in a quartet, and at 60 learned jazz piano. He studied art at Brooklyn College with New York School artists Mark Rothko, Ad Reinhardt, Alfred Russell, and Robert Jay Wolff. Following his graduation in 1952, he taught art and, after receiving a Master's degree in Counseling, served as a guidance counselor at Sheepshead Bay High School. Frustrated by the limited college and financial aid resources available to his students, Schwartz created a program to help the students explore options, navigate applications and obtain aid. Without assistance from the public school administration, Schwartz designed the Options program, obtained mainframe computer access, and researched college and aid data nationwide. He integrated a culture of participation and giving back: seniors worked and assisted the younger students in the Options office. It was the first of its kind in the country. After Options was instituted, students gained entrance to elite universities, graduated without debilitating debt, and achieved significant careers in the arts, investment banking, teaching, medicine and public health. Sol's Options program relocated to New York City's Goddard Riverside in 1985 where Sol built it into the gold standard college access program that today is a key partner to Michelle Obama's Reach Higher Initiative. The program remains as Sol intended it: non-profit, free of charge, available to all, providing the finest level of college and financial aid counseling services, all delivered free with one proviso, that Options' recipients give back to others when they can. After retiring from the school system, Sol returned to his first love: drawing. Combining his love of art with his love of music, theatre and dance, Sol began bringing a sketchbook to performances. Through the years he has sketched Andre Previn, Itzhak Perlman, Emanual Ax, Seiji Ozawa, Yo-Yo Ma, James Levine, Kurt Mazur, Katherine Dunham, Savion Glover, Mark Morris, the Juilliard and Emerson string quartets and others in performance. Sol said he drew during performances to convey ""the spirit of the concert that ineffable nature of a great performance. ""His art is published in the ""Drawing Music"" series and other books, all of artists drawn in performance. Sol's work is in many of the performers' homes. His art often includes a written comment from performers, such as cellist Sharon Robinson, who wrote ""Sol, thank you for capturing my soul."" The unique nature of Sol's art - artists captured in performance - is reflected in the dual introductions to his first book, Drawing Music: The Tanglewood Sketchbooks, with one introduction by Joel Smirnoff, the Juilliard String Quartet's first violinist, who wrote ""Schwartz has captured the unique stage and musical personality of each performer. And the sound of music permeates the atmosphere of each portrait...As performers, we as artists are ever grateful that Sol Schwartz has helped our expression linger in the air yet a moment longer. We celebrate him for his work and for his musicality,"" and the other introduction by art critic Colin Eisler, who wrote ""Sol's lyrical lines pay homage to the musician... retracing the mysterious union of individual, instrument and passion...[his] pages let us share the collective joy of hearing and seeing music made, we the beneficiaries of his arresting lines in all their ecstatic freedom and harmony."" Sol was dedicated to helping people experience the joy of learning. He was a donor to many organizations, including Shakespeare & Company, Children's Book Project, Theater for a New Audience, Kids4Harmony, Norman Rockwell Museum, Tanglewood, Jacob's Pillow, Ringling School of Art and Design, the Guitar Society, Asolo State Theater, La Musica, Perlman Music Program and the Florida Studio Theater. He also quietly helped many others when he saw an opportunity. The force of his interest in people and life, and his determination to help others was palpable. Sol was a loving husband to his first wife Lillian, a devoted father to Risa and David, and a delighted grandfather to John Cortner. After Lillian's death in 1999, Sol married Elayne P. Bernstein, who shared his passion for the arts and generosity, introducing him to Shakespeare & Company in Lenox. MA where he served as a trustee. In addition to his immediate family, Sol is survived by several cousins and countless friends who will deeply miss him. Memorial services will be held in Sarasota, FL on February 13 at 2pm and in Lenox, MA during the summer of 2016. Condolences may be sent to the family at P.O. Box 73, Lenox, MA 01240.

Artist, Designer, Mother and Friend. Hope F. Hudner died at home in Little Compton, RI on January 14, 2016 following a thirteen month battle with glioblastoma multiforme, a form of brain cancer. Hope is survived by her husband of 40 years, Michael, and her daughter, Bay, who were deeply involved as caregivers and comforters during the past year, and were at her side at the time of her peaceful passing. Hope is also survived by her aunt, Judy Freeman N. Gross; brothers, Ambassador Charles ""Chas"" W. Freeman, Jr. (Margaret Carpenter) and Robert P. Freeman (Inge Reist); their five children and nine grandchildren (Hope's grand-nieces and -nephews); siblings-in-law, Mr. Kennedy Hudner (Jennifer), Ms. Cornelia Futterman (Michael), and Ms. Kristina Beitman (Harty), and their five children. Hope was born on January 11, 1951 in Nassau, The Bahamas, and lived there until age 10, then alternating time in Southern California with years in Providence and Bristol, RI. Hope was predeceased by her son, Michael Ripley (""Rip"") Hudner, and her parents (father, Charles Wellman Freeman, and mother, Carla Park Freeman, who died when Hope was 20 months old). Hope was largely raised by her two sets of deceased grandparents, Hovey T. and Marjorie W. Freeman of Providence and Bristol, and Edward and Fentress K. Park of Wollaston, MA and Roaring Brook, MI. Hope graduated from The Lincoln School, Providence (1969), Smith College (1973), and also acquired an MFA from New York University. The family lived in New York City from 1974 through 1994, and then resided in Little Compton and Providence, RI. Hope was an accomplished artist and designer with a portfolio including work in graphic, interior, jewelry, and apparel design. These efforts led to her 2013 creation of Hope Hudner Designs, focused on elegant silk infinity scarves. Hope was deeply involved in Rhode Island public service, including, at various times, board and/or development responsibilities at Moses Brown School, Women & Infants Hospital, Rhode Islanders Sponsoring Education (RISE), RISD Museum, Perennial Planters, The National Society of the Colonial Dames of America (Rhode Island), and Providence Preservation Society. Hope's social involvements included membership in the Providence Art Club, Colony Club of New York City, Lyford Cay Club, Sakonnet Golf Club, and Sakonnet Point Club. Hope had great admiration for the natural world and actively cultivated a sense of wonder: she was a faithful student of plants and flowers (as evidenced by the thousands of bulbs planted across Rhode Island, Maine, and New York); she loved sailing with her family and friends (countless excursions on Narragansett Bay and longer trips to Maine, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, and Ireland number among the most special); and her keen curiosity led her to explore the far corners of the world, from Spain and Taiwan at age 18 to Antarctica at 49, covering every other continent and many countries in between. Hope had enormous energy, deep intelligence, natural grace, and remarkable warmth. She believed that life presented endless opportunity to learn, remarking on the tenth anniversary of her son's death that, ""Each time it rains in our lives, we are given an opportunity for further growth. I am grateful for the challenges in my life as chances to grow and blossom."" Hope faced her illness with the same fortitude and poise. While she was indeed a lifelong learner, Hope was perhaps most notable as a teacher of these invaluable lessons to the rest of us. Hope felt a profound duty to embrace everyone she encountered with love and kindness, and she shared this love of people and life like water from a fire hose. All within range were enriched by her presence and generosity of spirit. Hope inspired people to think lovingly and boldly on behalf of the larger community, themselves, and their friends, prompting many to find more inside themselves to enhance their own lives and those of others. A college classmate of Bay's said it beautifully in a recent note to Hope: ""You feature prominently as an inspiration for the life I want to live-to pursue my interests, to live fully and with panache, to spend time in nature, and, most of all, to be kind to people. I know I am just one of the many, many people you affect in this way!"" A celebration of Hope's life will be held in Little Compton in early June on a date to be announced. In lieu of flowers, the family suggests contributions in Hope's memory be made to: the Rip Hudner Memorial Fund at Moses Brown School, Providence; Dr. Patrick Wen's Research in Neuro-Oncology at Dana Faber Cancer Institute, Boston; or a charity of your choice. Above all, the family encourages you to remember Hope by engaging with the world through love and kindness. 1/3"

Mr. Kaufman, a Hollywood legend, played principal violin in over 500 films including Casablanca and Gone with the Wind. In his 2003 memoir, A Fiddler's Tale, he wrote that upon his proposal of marriage, Annette replied that she would like to be his accompanist. For the next 62 years, she was. They lived in Los Angeles, CA in a house designed for them by Lloyd Wright where, at the age of 101, Mrs. Kaufman died peacefully on January 25, 2016. The Kaufmans were well known in the Los Angeles pre-and post-war cultural scene. They were the first collectors of Milton Avery and, being softhearted and generous, helped many struggling painters during Depression-era America. In Brussels after the war, they were shown an obscure piece of music by Vivaldi, The Four Seasons; Mr. Kaufman became the first person to record it. A generous benefactor to many cultural institutions including the Library of Congress, the National Portrait Gallery and the Portland Art Museum, Annette was a vivid raconteur of a time in Europe and Los Angeles that, while largely faded from memory, lived on in her ebullient recounting of it. 1/3"

With his friend New York City Mayor John Lindsay and the American Lutheran Church, Mr. Smith brokered the 1977 expansion and relocation of Lutheran Medical Center from 4th Avenue and 46th Street to its present location, a former warehouse at 55th Street and 2nd Avenue in Sunset Park. He facilitated the creation of the Sunset Park Family Health Center, now called NYU Lutheran Family Health Centers, the second largest federally qualified health center network in the nation. He created a lasting financial foundation for Lutheran through Health Plus, an innovative government-sponsored insurance program for low-income residents. Lutheran's sale of Health Plus to Amerigroup in 2011 created an endowment that continues to help modernize the health system. Mr. Smith, a lifelong Brooklyn resident, was chairman emeritus of the United Hospital Fund, former president of the Brooklyn Public Library Board of Trustees, and past vice president and director of the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce. Mr. Smith received a bachelor's in chemical engineering from Princeton University and served in the U.S. Army.

Christina Bertrand Laney, age 83, of New York City died January 21, 2016. A classic ""New Yorker,"" in every sense of the word, Christina was a native of the Upper West Side for over 50 years. She was an avid Riverside Park gardener, a frequent face at Fairway, and knew every sidewalk crack and crevasse of the Upper West Side. The daughter of Vera Federoff, of Ryazan, Russia, and Bertrand J. Laney, of New York City, Christina was born in Hankow, China, on December 28, 1932, her family fleeing China in 1940, shortly after the Japanese offensive. A true explorer, Christina traveled the world with her family, attending schools in China, Panama, El Salvador, and finally, at the University of Texas, and at New York University. It was in 1953, that Christina, in her own words, ""found her Nirvana""-New York City. For over 30 years, she was involved in the entertainment industry, acting in small movie and television roles, then working behind the scenes in public relations, advertising, and film production. At United Artists, Christina was the Assistant to the Director of Special Projects for six years. She also worked for the Writer's Guild. Christina was a Vice President of Women of the Motion Picture Industry, and won their Dottie Reeves Humanitarian Award for Community Service. Christina's hobbies were manifold. Her diminutive size and powerhouse personality made her a natural spelunker. She was a member of the National Speleological Society for many years. A talented artist and poet in her own right, Christina supported Women in Motion Pictures, and the Curtain Club. She championed dozens of causes including: The Humane Society, The New York Historical Society, Sierra Club, The Wilderness Society, World Wildlife Fund, The Nature Conservancy, and the ASPCA. Christina was a lifelong volunteer for groups such as Channel 13, The Girl Scout Council of Greater New York, and, for 50 years, the Riverside Park Conservancy, where she was honored for her volunteer contribution in her beloved garden on 78th Street and Riverside Drive. Before there was Google, there was Christina. A voracious reader and a fount of knowledge about a myriad of subjects, especially New York City, family and friends could always rely on Christina for an irrefutable answer. Into her 80s, Christina was a brilliant, plucky, feisty spitfire who continued to stimulate her mind by regular attendance at jazz concerts, museums, art galleries, and theater. She was a devoted sister, aunt, cousin, and friend-a tiny woman with a huge spirit, who will be deeply missed. Christina is survived by her older sister, Kera Toline Rogers of Charleston, SC; niece Catherine Anna Toline, husband Leo Lentsch; nephews, John Colin Toline, and son John, Mark Anderson Toline, wife Ann, and son North, and Paul Alexander Toline; and cousins, Barbara Laney Swenson of Hanover, New Hampshire, Ainslie Drummond of Florida, and Irene Morgan Kay of Australia.
